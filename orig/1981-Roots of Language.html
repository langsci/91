of this
volume are based
would not
have been
possible without
the support
of NSF
Grants Nos.  GS-39748

S0C75-14481,
for which
grateful acknowledgment
is hereby
made. I
am also
indebted to
the University

together with
my regular sabbatical
leave, gave
me two

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>









Of all
the fields
of study
to which
human beings
have devoted
themselves, linguistics
could lay
claim to
being the
most conservative. Two
thousand five
hundred years
ago, Panini
began it
by describing
an individual human
language, and
describing individual
languages is
what the majority
of linguists
are still
doing. Even
during the
last couple
of decades, in
which linguists
have begun
to be
interested in
some of
the larger issues
that language
involves, the
main thrust
toward clarifying
those issues
has involved
making more
and more
detailed and
ingenious descriptions of
currently existing
natural languages. 
In  consequence,
little headway
has been
made toward
answering the
really important
questions which
language raises,
such as:
how is
language acquired
by the individual,
and how
was it
acquired by
the species?



The importance
of these
questions is,
I think,
impossible to
exaggerate. Language
has made
our species
what it
is, and
until we really
understand it-that
is,  understand 
what  is
necessary  for
it to
be
acquired and
transmitted, and
how it
interacts with
the rest
of our cognitive
apparatus-we cannot
hope to
understand ourselves.
And unless
we can
understand ourselves,
we will
continue to
watch in
helpless frustration
while the
world  we 
have  created 
slips further and
further from
our control.



The larger
and, in
a popular
sense, more
human issues
which language involves
lie outside 
the  scope  of
the  present 
work, and
will be dealt
with at
length in
a forthcoming
volume, {\itshape Language
and
Species.
}First,
there is
a good
deal of
academic spadework
to be
done. In
the chapters that
follow, I
shall try
to develop
a unified
theory which
willÂ·propose
at least
a partial
answer to
three questions,
none of
which has
as yet
been satisfactorily
resolved:






<ol>
	<li/>


How
	did creole
	languages originate?
	<li/>



	How do
	children acquire
	language?
	<li/>



	How did
	human language
	originate?
</ol>









'



<sub><b>xii	</b></sub>INTRODUCTION	<sup>INTRODUCTION</sup><b>	xiii</b>					Traditionally, these	three questions,	insofar as	they have	been treated at	all, have	been treated	as wholly
	unrelated. None
	of the
	solutions offered for
	(1)
	have had
	any relevance
	to (2)
	or (3);
	none 'of
	the solu&shy;
	tions offered
	for (2)
	have had
	any relevance
	to (1)
	or (3)
	; and
	none of the
	solutions offered
	for (3)
	have had
	any relevance
	to (1)
	or (2). It
	has even
	been explicitly
	denied, although
	without a
	shred of support&shy;
	ing evidence,
	that an
	answer to
	(1)
	could possibly
	be an
	answer to
	(3) (Sankoff 
	1979).
	Here and
	there, a
	few insightful
	scholars have
	hinted at possible
	links between
	the problems,
	and such
	insights will
	be ac&shy;
	knowledged in
	subsequent pages.
	However, a
	single, unified
	treatment has never
	even been
	attempted, and
	this book,
	whatever its
	short\-comings, may
	therefore claim
	at least
	some measure
	of originality.
	Doubtless many
	of its details
	will need
	revision or
	replacement; the
	explorer is
	seldom the
	best cartographer.
	However, of
	one thing
	I am totally
	convinced: that
	the three 
	questions  are 
	really one
	question, and that
	an answer
	to any
	one of
	them which does
	not at
	the same time
	answer the
	other two
	will be,
	ipso facto,
	a wrong
	answer.
	


	I shall
	begin with
	the origin
	of creoles.
	To some,
	this may
	appear the least 
	general  and 
	least  interesting
	question of
	the three.
	However, as I
	shall show,
	creoles constitute
	the indispensable 
	key  to
	the two larger
	problems, and
	this should
	come as
	no surprise
	to those
	familiar with the
	history of
	science, in
	which, repeatedly,
	the sideshow
	of one generation has
	been the
	central arena
	of the
	next. In
	Chapter 1,
	I shall examine
	the relationship 
	between  the
	variety  of Creole
	English spoken in
	Hawaii and
	the pidgin
	which immediately 
	preceded  it, 
	and  I
	shall show how
	several elements
	of that
	creole could
	not have
	been derived from
	its antecedent
	pidgin, or
	from  any 
	of  the 
	other  languages 
	that were in
	contact at
	the time 
	of  creole 
	formation,  and 
	that  therefore
	these elements
	must  have 
	been,  in 
	some  sense, 
	&quot;invented.&quot; In
	 Chap&shy;
	ter 2 
	I  shall 
	discuss  some 
	(not  all-there
	 would 
	not  be 
	space for 
	all) of
	the features
	which are 
	shared by 
	a wide
	range of
	creole languages
	and show
	some striking 
	resemblances  between
	 the 
	&quot;inventions&quot;
	 of Hawaii 
	and  &quot;inventions&quot;
	 of 
	other  regions 
	which  must 
	have  emerged
	


	quite  independently ;
	and I
	shall also
	try to
	probe  more deeply
	into
	


	'
	


	

	
	


	certain aspects
	of creole
	syntax and
	semantics which
	may prove
	signifi\-cant when
	we come
	to deal
	with the
	other two
	questions. In
	Chapter 3, which
	will deal
	with &quot;normal&quot;
	language acquisition  in
	 noncreole societies,
	I shall
	show that
	some of
	the things
	which children  seem to
	acquire effortlessly
	, as
	well as
	some which
	they get
	consistently wrong&shy;
	both equally
	puzzling to
	previous accounts
	of &quot;language 
	learning&quot;-
	follow naturally
	from the
	theory which was
	developed to
	account for creole
	origins: that
	all members
	of our
	species are
	born with
	a bio\-program
	for language
	which can
	function even
	in the
	absence of
	ade\-quate input.
	In Chapter
	4, I
	shall try
	to show
	where  this bioprogram
	comes from:
	partly from
	the species-specific
	structure of
	human perception and
	cognition, and
	partly from
	processes inherent
	in the expansion
	of a
	linear language. At
	the same
	time, we will
	be able
	to resolve the
	continuity paradox
	(&quot;language is
	too different
	from animal
	communication systems
	to have
	ever  evolved 
	from them&quot;;
	&quot;language,
	like any
	other adaptive
	mechanism, must
	have been
	derived by
	regular evolutionary
	processes&quot;) which
	has lain
	like some 
	huge  roadblock
	across the
	study of
	language origins.
	In the
	final chapter,
	I shall
	briefly summarize and
	integrate the
	findings of
	previous chapters,
	and suggest
	answers to
	some of the
	criticisms which
	may be
	brought against
	the concept of
	a genetic
	program for
	human language.

<b>PIDGIN</b><b>
</b><b>INTO</b><b>
</b><b>CREOLE</b>


































If one
wants to
account, ultimately,
for the
origins of
human language (as
I shall
try to
do in
Chapter 4),
it seems reasonable
for one to
begin by
trying to
find out
how individual
human languages
came into existence.
But, in
most cases,
such a
search would
be futile.
Mod\-ern Italian,
for example,
would be
found to
fade back
into a
maze of dialects
deriving ultimately
from Latin,
which developed
out of
Indo\-European, which
sprang, presumably,
from some
antecedent language
now wholly
inaccessible to
us; :md
at  no point
in the
continuous transmission of
language could
we name
a date
and say,
&quot;Here
Latin ended,&quot; or
&quot;Here Italian
began.&quot;



But there
is one
class of
languages for
which we
can point,
with reasonable accuracy,
to the
year of
birth: we
can say
that before
1530, there
was no
Sao Tomense;
before 1650,
no  Sranan; before
1690,
no Haitian  Creole;
 and 
before  1880,
no  Hawaiian 
Creole.  And 
yet  two or
three decades
after  those 
dates, those
languages existed.
Of course no
one would
claim that
these languages
were quite
devoid of
ancestry; indeed, their
relationships with
several sets
of putative
ancestors have been
and continue
to be
a subject
of controversy
(for a
critical sum&shy;
mary  and
bibliography  of
the relevant 
literature, see
Bickerton  1976).

	But even
	controversy could
	not exist
	unless the
	lines of
	descent were, at
	the very
	least, considerably
	more obscure
	than they  are
	for most other
	languages.
	


	Creole  languages 
	arose  as 
	a direct 
	result  of 
	European  colonial
	


	expansion. Between
	1500 and
	1900,
	there came
	into existence,
	on tropical islands
	and in
	isolated sections
	of tropical
	littorals, small,
	autocratic, rigidly
	stratified societies,
	mostly engaged
	in monoculture
	(usually of
	sugar), which
	consisted of
	a ruling
	minority from
	some European nation
	and a
	large mass
	of (mainly
	non-European) laborers,
	drawn in
	most cases
	from many
	different language
	groups. The
	early linguistic history
	of these
	enclaves is
	virtually unknown;
	it is
	generally assumed (but
	see Alleyne
	1971,
	1979)
	that speakers
	of different
	lan\-guages at
	first evolved
	some form
	of auxiliary
	contact-language, native
	to none
	of them
	(known as
	a {\itshape pidgin
	)
	,
	}and that
	this language,
	suitably expanded,
	eventually became
	the native
	(or {\itshape creole)
	}language of
	the community which
	exists today.
	These creoles
	were in
	most cases
	different enough
	from any
	of the
	languages of
	the original
	contact situation to
	be considered
	&quot;new&quot;
	languages. Superficially,
	their closest
	resemblance was
	to their
	European parent,
	but this
	was mainly
	because the bulk
	of the
	vocabulary items
	were drawn  from
	that source,
	and even here, 
	there  were 
	extensive  phonological
	 and 
	semantic  shifts.
	In the
	area of
	syntax, features
	were much
	less easily
	traceable.
	


	In general,
	the term
	{\itshape creole
	}is used
	to refer
	to  any  language
	which was
	once a
	pidgin and
	which subsequently
	became a
	native language ;
	some scholars
	have extended
	the term
	to any
	language, ex-pidgin or
	not, that
	has undergone
	massive structural
	change due
	to language contact
	(one who
	shall be
	nameless confessed
	to me
	that he did
	this solely
	to obtain
	access to
	a conference
	which, like
	most creole
	conferences, was
	held in
	an exotic
	tropical setting!).
	In fact,
	I think that
	even the
	traditional definition
	is too
	wide, since
	it covers
	a range of
	situations which
	may differ
	in kind
	rather than
	in degree.
	


	Since my
	aim here
	is not
	to account
	for the
	origins of
	all lan&shy;
	guages known
	as creoles
	(which would
	be an
	absurd aim
	anyway since they 
	do not 
	constitute a
	proper  set{ but 
	rather  to 
	search for
	certain
	


	

	
	


	fundamental properties
	of human
	language in
	general, my
	interests lie, not
	in  creoles  per 
	se, but 
	in  situations 
	where  the 
	normal  continuity
	of language
	transmission is
	most severely
	disrupted. While
	it is
	true that the
	circumstances under
	which  pidginization
	 and 
	creolization  take
	place represent
	&quot;a catastrophic
	break in
	linguistic tradition
	that is
	unparalleled&quot; (Sankoff
	1979:24),
	there are
	still a 
	number  of 
	areas where the
	severity  of 
	that  break 
	was  mitigated 
	by  other
	factors. Let us
	consider two
	quite different
	cases of 
	such  mitigation: 
	Reunion Creole and
	Tok Pisin
	(a.k.a.
	Neo-Melanesian,  New
	 Guinea 
	Pidgin, etc.).
	


	One factor
	that would
	limit the
	extent of
	language  disruption
	would be
	the  presence 
	of  any 
	large  homogeneous
	 linguistic 
	group in the 
	community-more 
	especially  if 
	that  group 
	happened  to
	consist of
	speakers of
	the dominant
	language.  According
	 to 
	Chaudenson (1974),
	in Reunion
	during the
	first  few 
	decades of
	settlement  nearly
	half the
	population consisted
	of native
	speakers of
	French ;
	in conse&shy;
	quence, although
	the resultant
	language bears
	the creole
	label, the
	distance between
	that language
	and French
	is much
	less than
	the distance between
	most creoles
	and their
	superstrates, while
	(more important still
	from the
	present viewpoint)
	the language
	differs in
	many respects from
	creoles formed
	where access
	to the
	superstrate was
	more restricted.
	


	In New
	Guinea, the
	percentage of
	superstrate speakers
	was low, but
	the pidgin 
	existed for
	several generations
	alongside the
	indigenous language
	before it
	began to 
	acquire  native 
	speakers. Thus
	Tok Pisin was
	able to
	expand gradually,
	through normal
	use, rather
	than very rapidly,
	under the
	communicative  pressure
	 of 
	a generation 
	that  had, for
	practical purposes,
	no other
	option  available 
	as a
	first  language.
	The bilingual
	speakers of
	Tok Pisin
	had ongoing
	lives in their
	own languages and,
	perhaps more
	importantly still,
	in their
	own traditional
	communities; whereas
	in the classic 
	creole situation,
	people had
	been torn from
	their traditional
	communities and
	forced into
	wholly novel
	communities in
	which the
	value of 
	traditional  languages
	was low 
	or nil.  The 
	two  situations 
	are  not  commensurate,
	 and 
	we  would
	expect

	to find,
	as we
	do, that while
	Tok Pisin differs
	from English much
	more than Reunion
	Creole does
	from French,
	it
	lacks,
	again, a
	number of the
	features found
	in the
	classic creole
	languages, and 
	possesses a number
	of features
	which those
	creoles, in
	turn, do
	not share.
	


	Accordingly,  in
	the text 
	that  follows,
	I shall
	use the
	word {\itshape creole}
	


	to refer
	to languages
	which:
	


	

	
	<ol>
		<li/>



		Arose out
		of a
		prior pidgin
		which had
		not existed
		for more
		than a
		generation.
		<li/>


Arose
		in a
		population where
		not more
		than 20
		percent were
	</ol>
	


	native speakers
	of the
	dominant language
	and where
	the remaining 80
	percent was
	composed of
	diverse language
	groups.
	


	

	
	


	The first
	condition
	rules out
	Tok Pisin
	and perhaps
	other (e.g.,
	Austra\-lian
	Aboriginal) creoles;
	the second
	rules out
	Reunion Creole
	and perhaps other
	creoles  also (the
	varieties of
	Portuguese creoles
	that evolved in
	Asian trading
	enclaves such
	as Goa
	or Macao
	are possible
	candidates
	for exclusion
	under this
	condition). Given
	the above,
	I shall
	continue to
	refer to
	certain languages
	or groups
	oflanguages as
	&quot;English creoles,&quot;
	&quot;French creoles,&quot;
	etc.; this
	usage implies
	no conclusions
	as to the
	affiliations
	of these
	languages and
	{\itshape is
	}merely
	for convenience.
	


	By limiting
	our research
	area in
	this way
	, it
	becomes possible
	to concentrate on
	those situations
	in which
	the human
	linguistic capacity
	is stretched
	to the
	uttermost. As
	I have
	said, we
	know little
	or nothing of
	the early
	linguistic history
	of most
	creoles, but
	what evidence
	we do have
	(e.g.,
	Rens 1953,
	for Sranan)
	suggests that
	they emerged
	from the pidgin
	stage fairly rapidly,
	within twenty
	or thirty
	years after
	first settlement of
	the areas
	concerned. Such
	a time
	span gives
	space for
	the first locally-born
	generation to
	come to
	maturity, but
	it hardly
	gives space for
	a stable,
	systematic, and
	referentially adequate
	pidgin
	to be
	evolved in
	a community
	which might
	initially speak
	dozens of
	mutually unintelligible
	languages; certainly,
	in the
	one case
	of which
	we have direct  
	knowledge   (Hawaii), 
	no  stale,
	 systematic, 
	or  referentially
	


	<sup>PIDGIN</sup><sup>
	</sup><sup>INTO</sup><sup>
	</sup><sup>CREOLE</sup>	5
	


	adequate  pidgin 
	had  developed 
	within  that 
	time  frame,
	and there
	are no real
	grounds for
	supposing that
	the Hawaiian 
	situation
	was any
	less favorahle
	to the
	development 
	of such
	a pidgin
	than were
	the situations
	in other
	creole-forming regions.
	We can
	assume, therefore,
	that in
	each of  these 
	regions,  immediately
	 prior 
	to creolization,
	there existed,
	just as  there 
	existed  in 
	Hawaii,  a
	highly  variable, 
	extremely  rudimentary
	language  state
	such  as
	has  been 
	sometimes described
	as a
	&quot;jargon&quot;
	 or &quot;pre-pidgin  
	continuum&quot;   rather
	  than  
	a  developed  
	pidgin   language.
	Since none 
	of the 
	available  vernaculars 
	would  permit 
	access to
	more than  a 
	tiny  proportion 
	of  the
	community,  and
	since the
	cultures  and communities
	with  which 
	those  vernaculars
	 were 
	associated  were
	now receding  rapidly
	 into
	the past,
	the child
	born of
	pidgin-speaking  parents
	would   seldom  
	have  had 
	any  other 
	option  than 
	to  learn 
	that  rudi&shy;
	mentary language,
	however inadequate
	for human
	purposes it
	might he.
	


	We should  pause
	here to
	consider the
	position of
	such children, for
	no one
	else has
	done so,
	even in
	the vast
	literature
	on language
	acquisition. That
	position differs
	crucially from
	the position
	of children in
	more normal
	communities. The
	latter have
	a ready-made,
	customÂ· validated,
	referentially adequate
	language to
	learn, and
	mothers, elder
	siblings, etc.,
	ready to
	help them
	learn it.
	The former
	have, instead,
	something which
	may be
	adequate for
	emergency use,
	but  which 
	is quite unfit
	to  serve 
	as  anyone's
	primary  tongue;
	which, by
	reason  of
	its variability
	, does not
	present even
	the little
	it offers
	in a
	form that would
	permit anyone
	to learn
	it; and
	which the
	parent, with
	the best will
	in the
	world,  cannot 
	teach,  since 
	that  parent 
	knows no
	more of the
	language than
	the child
	(and will
	pretty soon
	know less).
	Every\-where else
	in the
	world it
	goes without
	saying that
	the parent
	knows more language
	than the
	child; here,
	if the
	child is
	to have
	an adequate
	language,  he 
	must  speedily 
	outstrip  the 
	knowledge  of 
	the  parent. Yet
	every study of
	first-language
	acquisition that
	I know
	of assumes without
	question that
	the more
	general situation
	is universal;
	{\itshape every
	existing
	theory
	of
	acquisition
	
	is
	based
	
	on
	the
	presupposition
	
	that
	there
	is
	always
	and
	everywhere
	an
	adequate
	language
	to
	be
	acquired.}

	It is
	true that
	the  situation
	I am
	describing is
	extremely  rare
	and can
	indeed occur
	only once
	even for
	a creole
	language. However,
	the rarity
	or frequency
	of a
	phenomenon contains
	no clues
	as to
	its scientific
	importance.
	


	The  act 
	of  &quot;expanding&quot;
	 the 
	antecedent  pidgin,
	 which 
	each
	


	first creole
	generation has
	to undertake,
	involves, among
	other things,
	acquiring new
	rules of
	syntax. In
	the conventional
	wisdom, children
	are supposed
	to  derive 
	rules by 
	processing  input 
	(with or
	without the help
	of some
	specific
	language-learning device)
	; in
	this way,
	they arrive at
	a rule
	system similar
	to, if
	not identical
	with, that
	of their
	elders. If
	this were
	all children
	could do, then
	they would 
	simply learn the
	pidgin, and
	there would
	be no
	significant gap
	between the
	generations. In
	Hawaii, at 
	least, we
	have  empirical 
	proof  that 
	this did not
	happen-that the
	first creole
	generation produced
	rules for
	which there
	was no
	evidence in
	the previous
	generation's speech.
	


	How can
	a child
	produce a
	rule for
	which he
	has no
	evidence? No one
	has answered
	this question;
	most people
	haven't even
	asked it; and
	yet, until
	it is
	answered, we
	cannot really
	claim to
	know any&shy;
	thing about
	how languages in
	general are 
	acquired.  For
	it  violates both
	parsimony and
	common sense
	to suppose
	that children
	use one set
	of acquisition
	strategies for
	&quot;normal&quot;
	acquisition situations,
	and then switch
	to another
	set when
	they frnd
	themselves in
	a pidgin&shy;
	speaking community:
	parsimony  because
	 two 
	explanations  would
	be required
	where one
	should
	be adequate,
	and common
	sense because
	there is
	no way
	in which
	a child
	could tell
	what kind
	of community
	he had
	been born 
	into, and
	therefore no
	way he
	could decide
	which
	


	set of
	strategies to
	use.
	


	I shall
	return to
	the  topic of
	acquisition in
	Chapter 3;
	in
	the present
	chapter, I
	shall simply
	describe what
	happened  in
	Hawaii when pidgin
	turned into
	creole.
	


	

	
	


	For a
	century  after 
	the first 
	European  contact,
	the population of
	Hawaii consisted
	mainly of
	native Hawaiians,
	with a
	small but growing 
	minority  of 
	native  Englis 
	speakers.  A 
	small but 
	growing
	


	

	
	


	minority of
	Hawaiians spoke
	English with
	varying degrees
	of profi&shy;
	ciency; the
	lower end
	of this
	spectrum acquired
	the name
	{\itshape hapa-haole
	}'half-white'.
	{\itshape Hapa-haole
	}was not
	a true
	pidgin, or
	even a
	true pre&shy;
	pidgin, in
	the sense
	discussed above;
	rather it was
	a continuum
	of &quot;foreigner's
	English,&quot; similar
	to Whinnom'
	s (1971)
	description of
	{\itshape cocoliche.
	}It was,
	apparently, limited
	to the
	towns, still
	hardly heard in
	country areas
	even in
	the 1870s.
	There was
	a small
	sugar industry,
	but the
	labor force
	was almost
	entirely Hawaiian,
	and, as
	far as
	one can discover,
	the plantation
	work-language was
	Hawaiian.
	


	In 1876,
	a revision
	of U.S.
	tariff laws
	allowing the
	free importa&shy;
	tion of
	Hawaiian sugar
	caused the
	industry to
	increase its
	productivity by several
	hundred percent.
	The native
	Hawaiian population
	had so declined
	in numbers
	that workers
	had to
	be imported,
	first 
	from China, and
	then from
	Portugal, Japan,
	Korea, the
	Philippines, Puerto
	Rico, etc.
	In a
	few years
	there came
	into existence
	a multilingual
	community that
	greatly outnumbered
	the former
	population, Hawaiian
	and {\itshape haole
	}alike.
	


	A pidgin
	English was
	probably not
	the first,
	and certainly
	not the only,
	contact language
	used on
	the Hawaiian
	plantations  after
	1876.
	A pidgin
	based on
	Hawaiian and
	known as
	{\itshape olelo
	pa'i'ai
	}'taro\-language'
	-so
	called because
	it
	allegedly
	originated with
	the Chinese,
	who largely
	took over
	taro growing
	from the
	native Hawaiians-was
	widely used
	in the
	last two
	decades of
	the 19th
	century  (Bickerton 1977
	i307-8) and
	perhaps for
	some years
	afterward, since
	one speaker, a
	Filipino, was
	still alive
	in the
	mid-1970s. So
	far, it
	has proved
	impos\-sible
	to
	determine whether
	pidgin English
	grew up
	alongside pidgin
	Hawaiian
	or whether
	the former
	grew out
	of the
	latter by
	a gradual
	relexiflcarion process.
	The two
	processes may
	not be
	mutually exclu&shy;
	sive, especially
	when we
	consider that
	population balances
	and other
	demographic factors
	differed widely
	from island
	to island.
	But one certain
	consequence of
	the existence
	of {\itshape olelo
	pa'i'ai
	}is that
	it delayed the
	development of
	any form
	of pidgin
	English, especially
	on the outer
	islands, where
	the Hawaiian
	language was
	strongest.
	


	In 1973
	and 1974,
	I and
	my team
	of assistants
	made recordings




<sub>8	</sub><sup>ROOTS</sup><sup>
</sup><sup>OF</sup><sup>
</sup><sup>L</sup><sup>A</sup><sup>&quot;</sup><sup>.</sup><sup>IGUAGE	</sup><sup>PIDGIN</sup><sup></sup><sup>INTO</sup><sup></sup><sup>CREOLE</sup>	9					of several	hundred hours	of speech	from both	immigrant speakers	of Hawaiian Pidgin
	English (HPE)
	and locally-born
	speakers of
	Hawaiian Creole English
	(HCE); this
	work is
	described in
	detail in
	Bickerton and Odo
	(1976),
	Bickerton and
	Giv6n (1976),
	and Bickerton
	(1977
	). The
	earliest immigrant
	arrival in
	the group
	we recorded  was
	1907,
	a time which
	, if
	our theory
	about the
	delayed development
	of HPE
	is correct, may
	have been
	only a
	few years
	after the
	beginning of
	HPE. The latest
	arrival was
	1930.
	[n other
	words, a
	period of
	from forty&shy;
	three to
	sixty-six years
	had elapsed
	between our
	subjects' dates
	of arrival and
	our recordings.
	Can
	recordings made
	after such
	a long period
	give us
	an adequate
	idea of
	what  HPE
	was like
	in the
	period
	


	1907-1930?
	


	Although it
	is widely
	held that
	au individual's
	speech changes
	little after
	maturity has
	been reached,
	this may
	not necessarily
	be true of
	second languages
	or contact
	languages. Pidginization
	is a
	ptocess, not a
	state, and
	it is
	therefore possible
	that at
	least some
	of our
	subjects may now
	speak differently
	from the
	way they
	spoke when
	they first arrived
	in Hawaii,
	even though
	the vast
	majority were
	already adults at
	that time. 
	However, one
	thing is
	certain. If
	their version
	of HPE has
	changed in
	those intervening
	years, then
	it mnst
	be more
	complex in structure
	and less
	subject to
	idiosyncratic or
	ethnic-group variation
	than it
	was in
	the years
	that immediately
	followed their
	arrival. It
	is
	unthinkable
	that after
	several decades
	of life
	in a
	community that
	was steadily
	becoming more
	integrated their
	version of
	HPE should
	have grown less
	complex or
	more idiosyncratic.
	We must
	therefore assume
	that either
	their HPE
	now adequately
	represe11ts the
	HPE of
	the early
	pidginization period,
	or that
	the latter
	was even
	more  primitive and more
	unstable than
	the versions
	they use
	today.
	


	But even
	if
	modem HPE
	represents early
	HPE quite
	accurately,
	


	it does
	not follow
	that all
	HPE speakers
	are equally
	good guides to
	the state of
	HPE as
	it was
	when creolization
	took place.
	On the
	basis of evidence
	discussed at
	length in
	Bickerton (
	1977
	), we
	can place
	the time of
	creolization somewhere
	around 1910,
	and certainly
	no later
	than 1920.
	There are
	considerable differences
	between the
	HPE spoken
	by
	


	\
	


	

	
	


	the earliest
	arrivals among
	our subjects
	and that
	spoken by
	those who arrived
	in the
	1920s.
	The former
	is considerably
	more rudimentary
	in its structure;
	the complications
	that developed
	after 1920
	could have been
	due to
	internal developments
	in
	HPE, but
	were more
	probably
	


	caused by
	feedback from
	the newly-developed
	HCE, whose
	earliest speakers would
	have come
	to maturity
	by 1920
	if
	not before
	(this issue, too,
	is explicitly
	dealt with
	in Bickerton
	[1977
	:Chapter
	4]).
	We shall therefore
	make the
	reasonable assumption
	that at
	the time
	of creolization HPE
	was either
	adequately represented
	by our
	recordings of earlier
	 (pre-1920)
	immigrants,  or
	it
	was at
	a still
	more primitive
	


	level of
	development.
	


	At first
	glance, the
	second possibility
	might seem
	hard to
	credit. The HPE
	of the
	older surviving speakers
	is both
	highly restricted
	and highly variable.
	The main
	source  of instability
	is
	first-language
	influ\-ence. Labov
	(1971)
	 claimed 
	that  these
	transference-governed 
	versions of
	HPE were
	the idiosyncratic
	inventions of
	social isolates;
	our much more
	widely-based  research
	 indicates
	that  instead 
	they  represent 
	one of the
	earliest stages
	in the
	pidginization process
	in which
	the more isolated the
	speakers, the
	more likely
	they are
	to become
	fossilized. However,
	speakers who
	produced such
	versions were
	by no
	means all socially
	isolated, and
	in particular,
	we noted
	that speakers
	of more evolved
	versions of
	HPE would
	sometimes relapse
	into this
	mode when they
	became excited
	or when
	they had
	to deal
	with complex
	or un&shy;
	familiar topics
	(the speaker
	who  produced
	!121
	below also
	produced, in
	the middle
	of a
	long and
	exciting narrative,
	{\itshape !21).}
	


	Typical of
	very early
	HPE as
	produced by
	speakers born
	in Japan are
	the following:
	


	

	
	


	/1/ mista
	karsan-no {\itshape tokoro
	}tu eika sel
	{\itshape shite
	}Mr.
	Carson-POSS place
	two acre
	sell do 'I
	sold two
	acres to
	Mr.
	Carson's place'
	


	/2/	{\itshape sore
	kara
	}kech
	{\itshape shite
	k
	ara
	}pul
	ap
	and
	then
	catch
	do
	then
	pull
	up
	


	'When he
	had caught
	it, he
	pulled it
	up'

	In these
	examples, the
	italicized lexical
	items are
	Japanese,  and 
	ana\-phora is
	maintained by
	zero forms
	rather than
	by pronouns.
	In {\itshape I
	}1/
	the structure (with
	both  direct 
	and  indirect 
	objects  preceding
	 the 
	verb and the
	auxiliary following
	the main
	verb) represents
	direct transference
	from Japanese
	syntax. Example
	/2/ can
	hardly be
	said to
	have anything
	recognizable as
	structure;
	lexical items
	from the
	English and
	Japanese lexicons are
	simply strung
	together.  But 
	what  is
	striking  about
	these two sentences
	is that
	six out
	of the
	seven Japanese
	morphemes are
	grammatical, not
	lexical, items;
	it is
	as if
	the speakers
	felt the
	need for some
	kind of
	grammatical glue
	with which
	to stick their
	sentences together, and
	perforce used
	the only
	brand  available to
	them.
	


	Â·Speakers who
	immigrated into
	areas where
	there was
	a large
	native-Hawaiian population
	show a
	rather different
	tendency ;
	here, it
	is Hawaiian
	rather than
	native-language
	vocabulary that
	is mixed
	with English items:
	


	

	
	


	/3/
	   
	ifu
	laik
	meiki,
	mo
	beta
	{\itshape mak
	e
	}tairn,
	mani
	no
	kaen
	{\itshape hapai}
	


	if like
	make, more
	better die time,
	money no
	can carry
	


	'If you
	wanted to
	build (a
	temple), you
	should do
	it just
	before you die--you
	can't
	take it
	with you!'

	'Who'll carry

	Example /3/
	was uttered
	by a
	Japanese speaker,
	/4/ by
	a Filipino
	speaker; note
	that the
	predominantly OV
	syntax of
	the former
	is replaced  by 
	a predominantly 
	VS  syntax
	in the
	latter, reflecting
	the
	


	

	
	


	That the
	macaronic elements
	in these
	examples may
	represent a
	deliber\-ate str:tegy
	on the
	part of
	speakers is
	suggested by
	the following
	perceptive comment
	from an
	old Hawaiian
	woman:
	


	

	
	


	{\itshape 15/
	}So we
	use the
	Hawaiian and 
	Chinese together
	in one
	sentence, see?
	And they
	ask me
	if that's
	a Hawaiian
	word, I
	said no,
	maybe that's a
	Japanese word
	we put
	it in,
	to make
	a sentence
	with a Hawaiian
	word. And
	the Chinese
	the same
	way too,
	in order
	to make a
	sentence for
	them to
	understand  you.
	


	

	
	


	In
	other
	w<sub>.</sub>ords,
	in the
	original linguistic
	meltincr pot
	from which
	HPE venrnally issued,
	the more
	skilled speakers
	acquired a
	core vocabulary
	


	m which
	the commonest
	items, both
	lexical and
	grammatical, might
	be represented by
	forms drawn
	from three
	or four
	languages. Small
	won\-der that
	a Japanese
	woman, asked
	if she
	spoke English
	, answered:
	&quot;No, {\itshape haf&quot;&quot;har:a
	}[Hawaiia;t
	'.half-half'] {\itshape shite
	}[Japanese
	'do'] &quot;-i.e.,
	'I
	speak a
	


	nuxture -and
	added (m
	Japanese), &quot;I
	never know
	whether I'm
	speaking one thing
	or the
	other.&quot;
	


	Even at
	a subsequent
	stage of
	pidginization,
	represented by
	speaker whose
	vocabulary is
	drawn
	predominantly from
	English, sntacti
	features characteristic
	of their
	native languages
	will still
	distmgmsh, for
	example, Japanese
	from Filipino
	speakers. The
	former continue to
	produce sentences
	such as
	/6/ and
	/7/,
	with final
	verbs:
	


	<sup>/6/		</sup>tumach
	mani mi
	tink kechi
	do plenty money
	I think
	catch though
	


	'I
	think he
	earns a
	lot of
	money, though'


	


	speaker's native
	Visayan. Here,
	however, all
	the Hawaiian
	items carry
	lexical meaning,
	in contrast
	with the
	Japanese items
	in /1/
	 and 
	/2/; this
	lends support
	to the
	claim that
	even as
	late as
	the 1910s,
	in some
	


	/7/
	


	da pua
	pip!awl
	poteito it
	


	'The poor
	people ate
	only potatoes'


	


	areas,  either 
	{\itshape olelo
	pa'i'ai
	
	}was 
	still dominant, 
	or  its
	relexiflcation  by
	


	English was
	still far
	from complete.
	


	Certainly examples
	/1/-/4/ 
	suggest an
	extreme instability
	in the
	language model
	that  would  confron
	the first
	locally-born
	generation.
	


	Filipinos, however,
	often produce
	sentences in
	which verbs
	or predicate
	adjectives precede
	their subjects:
	


	

	
	


	/8/	wok had
	dis pipl
	


	'These people
	work hard'

	The patterns

	and 90

	Bickerton and
	Giv6n  [1976]
	 for

	while among   Filipinos,
	  percentages  
	of   VS  
	structures   ranged
	  between  
	15 percent
	and 50

	indefinite; Filipino
	speakers, on
	the other
	hand, often
	over-generalized the
	definite article, as
	in /9/
	above. While
	both  groups 
	relied  on
	zero anaphora more
	than English
	does, pronouns
	were far
	more frequent
	among Filipino speakers.
	In short,
	anyone  (in  particular
	 a 
	child)  trying
	to learn HPE
	would have
	encountered formidable
	obstacles  to 
	even figuring out
	what the
	rules of
	HPE were
	supposed to
	be.
	


	But its
	variability was
	by no
	means the
	only obstacle
	to child
	acquisition of
	HPE. The
	presence of
	two conflicting
	models, A
	and B, still
	leaves the
	learner three
	theoretical choices:
	learn A,
	learn B,
	or learn some
	mixture of
	A and
	B. But
	when neither
	of the
	models, nor the
	two together,
	constitutes an
	adequate variety
	of human
	language, the problem
	is of
	a different
	order altogether.

	Since the
	Japanese and

	consti&shy;
	


	Let us
	be  quite clear
	as to
	what the
	deficiencies of
	HPE were,
	for


	


	tuted the
	two largest
	immigrant groups,
	a child
	in Hawaii
	who sought to
	learn basic
	word order
	by inductive
	processes alone
	would have ended
	up in
	a state
	of total
	bewilderment.
	


	Other  features 
	besides  word 
	order  distinguish
	 Japanese 
	from
	


	Filipino speakers.
	Among Japanese,
	when-clauses were
	frequently expressed by
	compound nominals
	such as:
	


	

	
	


	/10/	as-bihoa-stei-taim
	us-before-stay-time
	


	'when
	we used
	to live
	here'
	


	

	
	


	Filipinos never
	used such
	expressions, except.
	fr
	{\itshape sma':'.
	tim
	}'when I
	was young',
	which became
	a universal HPE
	1d10m.
	Fil1pmo
	peakers inserted pronouns
	between most
	full-noun subjects
	and their
	verbs,
	


	for example:
	


	

	
	


	<sub>/11/
	</sub><sub>
	</sub>josafin
	brada
	hi
	laik
	{\itshape hapai
	}mi
	


	'Josephine's brother
	wants to
	take me
	(with him)'
	


	

	
	


	Japanese speakers
	seldom if
	ever ued
	this structure.
	With regard
	to
	


	it
	has been
	claimed (e.g.,
	Samarin 1971)
	that
	anything at
	all
	can be
	said in a
	pidgin. There
	is a
	sense in
	which this
	is probably
	correct, even
	of an immature
	pidgin like
	HPE, provided
	we do
	not count
	the cost
	of saying it.
	Take the
	following
	remarkable speech:
	


	

	
	


	/12/

	rod get,
	samtalm, olsem
	hen get,

	'Sometimes there's

	This philosophic
	statement would
	be a
	striking piece
	of rhetoric
	in
	any language. But
	 it is
	an achievement
	against the
	grain of
	the language,
	so to speak;
	the speaker,
	a retired
	bus driver
	(which probably
	accounts for his 
	choice  of
	imagery),  triumphs
	 by 
	sheer  force 
	of imagination 
	over

	the  minimal

	If it
	were the
	case that
	children simply
	induced rules
	from input,


	


	

	
	


	It
	is not
	absolutely necessary,
	for communicative
	purposes, that a
	language have
	either an
	extensive vocabulary
	or a
	variety of
	syntactic structures; but
	the goals
	of language,
	whether social
	communication or
	mental computation,
	seem to
	be better
	served if
	a language
	has these things.
	HPE lacks,
	wholly or
	partially, many
	of the
	building blocks
	which all
	native languages
	possess. Among
	HPE speakers
	who arrived prior
	to 1920,
	the following
	features
	are largely
	or completely
	missing: consistent
	marking of
	tense, aspect,
	and modality;
	relative clauses;
	movement rules,
	embedded complements,
	in particular
	infinitival con&shy;
	structions; articles,
	especially indefinite.
	On the
	rare occasion
	when such features
	do appear,
	they often
	do so
	in forms
	modeled directly
	on the
	speaker's native
	language-for 
	example,  the 
	relative  clauses
	that precede,
	rather than
	follow, their
	head-nouns that
	are sometimes
	produced by
	Japanese speakers:
	


	

	
	


	/ 14/	aen
	luk laik
	pankin kain
	get
	


	and look
	like pumpkin
	kind get
	


	'And there
	were some
	that looked
	like pumpkins'
	


	

	
	


	For the
	most part,
	however, sentences
	would consist  of
	short strings of
	nouns and verbs
	paratactically linked.
	Often even
	verbs would be
	omitted, as
	in the
	following two examples:
	


	'
	


	one might
	suppose that
	when children
	were born
	to HPE
	speakers they
	learned the
	grammars of
	their parents.
	If their
	parents were
	Filipinos, they would
	learn the
	rules characteristic
	of Filipino
	speakers; if
	their parents were
	Japanese, they
	would learn
	the rules
	characteristic of
	Jp&quot;:'ese
	speakers, and
	so on.
	One might
	argue that when
	Japanese and
	Fil1prno children
	went to
	school they
	met one
	another and
	ironed out
	their differences;
	but if
	this, or
	something like
	it, did
	rake place,
	it must ave
	had  mre
	to do
	with  their
	being children 
	than with
	their being
	rn contact
	with one
	another. Fifty
	years of
	contact were
	not enough
	to
	


	erase language-group
	differences from
	the speech
	of adults,
	And while similar
	phenomena have
	been observed
	among children
	of immigrant
	groups on
	the U.S.
	mainland, it
	must be
	remembered  that
	.the latter
	


	had a
	ready-made target,
	while  the 
	first  creole
	generation  in 
	Hawaii did not.
	


	Whatever processes
	were involved,
	the erasure
	of group
	differ\-ences in
	that generation
	was complete.
	Even other
	locally-born persons
	cannot determine
	the ethnic
	background of
	an HCE
	speaker by 
	his speech alone,
	although  the 
	same  persons 
	can  readily 
	identify  that
	of an HPE
	speaker by
	listening to
	him for
	a few
	seconds.
	


	Now it
	is true
	that we
	could construct
	an argument
	similar to that
	already constructed
	for HPE
	speakers. The
	reader will
	recall the claim
	that while
	the contemporary
	speech of
	old HPE
	speakers may
	be the same
	as, or
	more developed
	than, their
	speech shortly
	after time of


	


	

	


	


	16	<sup>ROOTS</sup><sup> </sup><sup>OF</sup><sup>
	</sup><sup>LANGUAGE</sup>
	


	

	
	


	arrival, it
	could hardly
	be less
	developed. Similarly,
	one might
	claim that older
	HCE speakers
	do not
	necessarily speak
	now as
	they spoke in
	their childhood
	or early
	maturity; that,
	again, it
	would be
	absurd to suggest
	that they
	then spoke
	a variety
	more developed 
	than  they
	speak now;
	and that,
	therefore, their
	speech may
	have changed
	and become considerably
	more complex
	since they
	reached adulthood.
	Indeed, on
	this showing,
	they might
	have spoken
	, as
	children, varieties
	as rudimentary
	and as
	ethnic-tongue-influenced
	as their
	parents did;
	subsequently, and
	very gradually,
	they could
	have  developed 
	the more stable,
	yet more
	complex, variety
	of!anguage
	that they
	use today. If
	this were
	true, the
	apparently sudden
	break between
	HPE and
	HCE would be
	a misleading
	artifact of
	the analysis,
	produced by
	back\-projection from
	synchronic data.
	


	Since we
	lack direct
	evidence from
	the period
	in question,
	this argument cannot
	be  conclusively
	disproved. However,
	it
	is an
	im\-plausible one,
	and for
	the following
	reason. If
	the argument
	is correct
	, then the
	homogeneity of
	modern HCE
	must have
	come about 
	by  a gradual
	leveling process
	in which
	group differences
	were gradually
	removed through
	intergroup contacts.
	What  were 
	the  critical 
	differ\-ences between
	the immigrant
	and first
	locally-born generations?
	Not, apparently,
	bilingualism versus
	monolingualism, since
	all the
	older, locally-born
	subjects we
	interviewed
	spoke at
	least one
	other language
	besides HCE
	when they
	were children.
	The only
	significant
	difference between
	the two
	generations is
	that the 
	first  encountered
	 HPE 
	as adults, while
	the second
	encountered it
	as small
	children.
	


	Similar arguments
	can be
	mounted with
	regard to
	the greater
	complexity of
	HCE. Again,
	we cannot
	prove empirically
	that this
	complexity  did 
	not  result 
	from  gradual 
	increment.  If
	we assume 
	that it did,
	however, we
	have to
	explain why
	HPE did
	not also
	become more
	complex; and
	we can
	only conclude,
	again,  that 
	such an
	explanation must lie
	in the
	difference between
	language-learning by
	adults and
	language-learning by
	children.
	


	Finally, as
	we will
	see in
	Chapter 2,
	the forms
	and structures
	arrived at
	by HCE
	resemble far
	beyond the
	scope of
	chance the
	forms

	and structures
	arrived at
	by a
	variety of
	other creole
	languages, often
	with substrata
	very different
	from Hawaii's 
	(and  from 
	one  another's
	too). It
	defies belief
	that a
	language formed
	by the
	leveling of
	several substratum-influenced
	versions of
	a pidgin
	should exhibit
	the degree
	of identity
	that will
	be illustrated
	with languages
	so diverse
	in their
	origins, all
	of which
	must have
	evolved in
	a similar
	manner; the
	odds against
	this happening, unless
	some set
	of external
	guiding principles
	was condi&shy;
	tioning  the 
	result,  must 
	be  fantastic. 
	It  seems
	reasonable,  therefore,
	to assume
	that the
	gap between
	HPE and
	HCE that
	is reflected
	in our data
	is a
	gen uine
	phenomenon, accounted
	for by
	extremely abrupt
	changes :'hich
	took place
	while the
	first creole
	generation was
	growing
	


	{\itshape to
	}maturity.
	



	
	



	
	


	I shall
	now examine
	some of
	the substantive
	differences between
	HPE and
	HCE in
	the following
	five areas:
	


	

	
	<ol type="a">
		<li/>


movement
		rules
		<li/>



		articles
		<li/>



		verbal auxiliaries
	</ol>
	


	d)
	{\itshape for-to
	
	}complementization
	


	e) relativization 
	and pronoun-copying
	


	

	
	


	I claimed
	above that
	HPE had
	no movement
	rules. In
	fact, HPE could
	not have
	had any
	movement rules
	if
	we use
	the term
	in a
	rather restricted sense
	to cover
	processes such
	as those
	which convert
	senÂ· tences like
	/17/
	and /19/
	into
	sentences like
	/18/ and
	/20/:
	


	

	
	


	{\itshape {17/	}I
	spoke
	{\itshape to
	}John.
	


	/18/	It was
	John that
	I spoke
	to.
	


	/19/	Mary
	loaned us
	a book.
	


	/20/	The one
	who loaned
	us a
	book was
	Mary.
	


	

	
	


	Rules
	of this
	kind  are
	generally  associated
	with  certain
	functions, e.g.,


	


	18	<sup>RO</sup><sup>O</sup><sup>TS</sup><sup>
	</sup><sup>OF</sup><sup>
	</sup><sup>L</sup><sup>A</sup><sup>'</sup><sup>,</sup><sup>)</sup><sup>!</sup><sup>GUAGE</sup>					that	of	focusing	one	particular	constituent	of	a	sentence,
	and
	they
	perform
	this
	function
	in
	some
	English
	cases
	by
	adding
	structure
	but
	always
	by
	changing
	the
	basic,
	unmarked
	word
	order
	of
	the
	sentence.
	


	We
	saw
	that
	in
	HPE
	there
	were
	several
	possible
	sentence
	orders:
	SVO,
	for
	all
	speakers
	sometimes;
	SOV,
	very
	often
	for
	Japanese
	speak&shy;
	ers;
	and
	VS,
	quite
	often
	for
	Filipino
	speakers.
	However,
	sfuce
	Japanese
	speakers
	hardly
	ever
	produced
	VS
	sentences,
	and
	Filipino
	speakers
	hardly
	ever
	produced
	SOV
	sentences,
	the
	use
	of
	the
	non-SVO
	structures
	could
	hardly
	indicate
	focns
	or
	any
	similar
	emphatic
	device;
	they
	served
	merely
	as
	(probably
	unintentional)
	signals
	of
	ethnicity.
	Even
	within
	a
	


	group-say;
	the
	Japanese-it
	could
	hardly
	be
	the
	case
	that
	
	SVO
	
	(or
	SOV)
	represented
	an
	unmarked
	order,
	while
	SOV
	(or
	SVO)
	represented
	a
	marked
	order.
	For
	instance,
	if
	SOV
	were
	the
	basic
	order,
	and
	SVO
	a
	marked
	order,
	those
	speakers
	who
	produced
	only
	30
	percent
	SOV
	would
	be
	using
	their
	marked
	order
	more
	than
	twice
	as
	often
	as
	their
	basic
	order.
	But
	if
	the
	relationship
	were
	reversed,
	the
	result
	would
	be
	just
	as
	unlikely
	
	for
	those
	
	speakers
	who
	
	produced
	
	60
	percent
	
	SOV.
	If
	there
	were
	two
	groups,
	one
	with
	basic
	SOV
	and
	marked
	SVO,
	and
	the
	other
	with
	basic
	SVO
	and
	marked
	 SOV,
	then
	it
	would
	become
	impossible
	for
	the
	listener
	to
	be
	sure
	whether
	contrastive
	emphasis
	was
	or
	was
	not
	intended,
	and
	the
	whole
	purpose
	of
	movement
	rules
	would
	be
	lost..We
	can
	therefore
	assume
	that
	differences
	in
	word
	order
	among
	HPE
	speakers
	are
	not
	the
	result
	of
	movement
	rules
	but
	 are
	due
	to
	a
	gradual
	transition
	from
	VS
	or
	SOV
	orders,
	unmarked
	in
	the
	speakers'
	native
	languages,
	to
	the
	equally
	.
	unmarked
	SVO
	which
	characterizes
	almost
	all
	contact
	languages.
	


	In
	HCE,
	the
	situation
	is
	quite
	different.
	HCE
	is
	homogeneous
	(except
	to
	the
	extent
	that
	it
	has
	been
	increasingly
	influenced
	by
	English
	in
	recent
	years)
	both
	across
	and
	within
	all
	groups
	irrespective
	of
	the
	parents'
	language
	background.
	For
	all
	speakers,
	without
	question,
	the
	basic,
	unmarked
	word
	order
	is
	SVO.
	All
	speakers,
	however,
	have
	rules
	that
	
	will
	
	move
	
	either
	
	objects-/21/,
	
	/22/-or
	
	predicates-/23/,
	
	/24/-to
	the
	beginning
	of
	the
	sentence:

	Object-fronting

	wishes
	to
	contrast

	This
	can
	
	be
	
	shown
	if
	we
	look
	at
	some
	context
	for
	/22/,

	has
	just
	denied
	
	knowledge
	
	of
	
	supernatural

	and
	uses
	object-fronting
	


	to
	mark
	the
	exception
	to
	this
	denial,
	as
	soon
	as
	it
	is
	brought
	to
	his
	attention.
	


	Predicate-fronting
	occurs
	when
	a
	predicate
	that
	contains
	new
	information
	is
	introduced
	in
	conjunction
	with
	a
	subject
	which
	has
	been
	explicitly
	stated
	or
	implied
	in
	the
	
	immediately
	
	preceding
	
	discourse.
	This
	can
	be
	shown
	by

	Here, the
	speaker realizes
	that what
	he said
	in the
	first two
	sentences may seem
	plainly false
	in light
	of what
	the interviewer
	can see
	before him. Since
	{\itshape trees,
	}although their
	presence has
	been denied,
	have been
	established as
	a topic, he
	can emphasize
	the recency
	of the
	presently visible trees'
	appearance by 
	fronting the
	predicate,
	


	This  congruence 
	between  movement 
	rule  and 
	discourse  feature
	


	is, of
	course, peculiar
	to HCE;
	one cannot
	fmd any
	similar congruence
	between discourse and
	variant ordering in
	HPE. In
	fact, the
	result of
	the HCE rules
	is a
	series of
	orderings which
	differs markedly
	from the possible
	orderings of
	HPE, both
	in that
	it contains
	orders which 
	HPE does not
	permit, and
	in that
	it does
	not contain
	orders which
	HPE does permit.
	The situation
	is shown
	in Table 
	1.1:
	


	

	
	


	<sub>Order	</sub>HPE	<sup>HCE</sup>
	


	<sub>SVO	</sub>yes	<sup>yes</sup>

	ovs	<sup>no	</sup><sup>yes</sup>
	


	Table 1.1:
	Word order in HPE
	and HCE
	


	

	
	


	The SOV
	order which
	is the
	commonest among
	older Japanese HPE
	speakers does
	not exist
	in
	HCE. While
	VS may
	occur in both
	HPE and HCE,
	its source
	is different
	in
	each case:
	in HPE,
	it
	stems from
	the retention of
	verb-first ordering;
	in HCE,
	from the
	operation of
	a regular rule.
	That rule,
	if it
	applies to
	transitive sentences,
	yields VOS
	order in HCE
	since objects
	and other
	constituents of
	the verb-phrase
	move
	


	with the
	verb:

	plei futbawl,
	dis gaiz
	


	'These
	guys don't
	want to play
	football'
	


	

	
	


	But although
	VOS is
	a possible
	order  in
	Philippine languages,
	it does not
	emerge in
	HPE, possibly
	because of
	the absence
	of either
	case\-marking or
	consistent intonation
	to distinguish
	the  roles 
	of  the 
	two NPs.
	


	As  for 
	the  two 
	remaining  orders,
	 OSV 
	and  OVS, 
	which  are
	


	present in
	HCE but
	not in
	HPE, the
	Â£rst arises
	through object-fronting,
	while the
	second can
	occur when
	both object-
	and predicate-fronting
	apply to
	the same
	sentences. The
	result, though
	infrequent, is
	occasion\-ally found
	and is
	judged grammatical
	by native
	speakers:
	


	

	
	


	/28/	difren bilifs
	dei get,
	sam gaiz 'Some
	guys have
	different beliefs'
	


	

	
	


	There is
	no way
	in which
	the sentence
	orders that
	are produced, or
	the rules
	which produce
	them, could
	have been
	acquired by
	the first creole
	generation from
	their pidgin-speaking
	parents. Moreover,
	even if
	we assume
	extensive bilingualism
	in that
	generation, those
	rules could not
	have been
	derived from
	either the
	substrate languages,
	or from English.
	Thtee substrate
	languages (Chinese,
	Portuguese, Spanish),
	as well
	as English
	, have
	underlying SVO
	order, bnt
	Chinese and
	English do not
	permit verb-first 
	or  predicate-fast
	 sentences,
	except for
	one or two
	highly marked
	structures like
	English left-dislocated
	pseudo\-clefts {\itshape (Told
	the
	landlord
	,
	that's
	what
	he
	did).
	}Portuguese
	and Spanish
	are freer
	in their
	ordering, tolerating
	certain types
	of verb-first
	sen\-tences, but
	the equivalents
	of VOS
	sentences like
	/27/
	and OVS
	sen\-tences
	like /28/
	would be
	ungrammatical in
	these languages.
	Conversely, the common
	Iberian VSX,
	as exemplified
	by Port
	uguese, would
	be ungrammatical in
	HCE:

	which moves
	either of
	the two
	


	major  constituents, 
	NP  and 
	VP,  to

	</sup>We
	may
	


	therefore claim
	that the
	rules  which move
	NPs and 
	VPs cannot
	have been acquired
	inductively by
	the original
	HCE speakers,
	but must,
	in some sense
	of the
	term, have
	been  &quot;invented&quot;
	by them
	ah ovo.
	



	
	


	

	
	


	Next, let
	us look
	at articles.
	These appear
	sporadically and
	unpredictably in
	HPE; typical 
	of  early  (mainly
	 Japanese) 
	speakers is the
	92-year-old
	1907
	arrival who
	produced only
	three indefinite
	articles (out of
	32 that
	would have
	been required
	by English
	rules of
	reference, i.e., 9.4
	percent) and
	seven definite
	articles (out
	of a
	total of
	40. that English
	rules would
	have required,
	i.e.,
	17.5 percent).
	Filipino speakers,
	on the
	other hand,
	generalized the
	definite articles 
	to many 
	environ\-ments in
	which English
	does not
	require them,
	for example: 
	with generic NPs,
	as in
	{\itshape 191
	}above;
	where there
	is only
	one possible
	refer\-ent, as
	in /30/ 
	or  /31/;
	where  there 
	is  a 
	clearly  nonspedfic
	 referent, as
	in /32/;
	or where
	noncount  nouns
	are involved,
	as in
	/33/:
	


	

	
	


	/30/	hi get

	All
	other NPs
	have no

	three

	by

	{\itshape -s,

	/37
	/,
	
	/43/.
	
	But
	
	note
	


	that the
	absence of
	plural marking
	in the
	last two
	cases certainly
	does not stem
	from any
	more general
	absence of
	pl uralization
	in HCE; specific
	NPs with
	plural reference
	are always
	appropriately marked
	in HCE (although
	not  in HPE),
	except where
	numerals  or other
	clear signs of
	plurality are
	already present.
	


	The
	fact
	that
	HCE
	unites
	in
	a
	
	single
	
	category
	
	what
	
	English
	treats
	as
	discrete
	categories
	has
	led
	to
	
	some
	curious
	analyses,
	such
	as
	that of
	Perlman
	(1973:99)
	who
	writes:
	&quot;(/)s
	that
	
	mark
	
	generic
	singular
	NP
	should
	be
	distinguished
	from
	those
	that
	mark
	
	indefinite
	
	singular
	ones.
	The
	
	distinction
	
	may
	
	be
	
	quite
	
	difficult
	
	to
	
	make.
	
	In
	
	such
	
	cases
	as
	{\itshape they
	go
	beer
	parlor,
	Ewa
	was
	never
	using
	crane
	that
	date,
	that
	is
	hund
	red-pound

	those
	days
	they

	icebox,
	}and
	{\itshape olden
	days
	we
	gotta
	ride
	train,
	}it
	may
	actually
	be
	neutralized;
	however,
	I
	have
	dis&shy;
	tinguished
	generic
	from
	indefinite
	where
	possible
	and
	discarded
	un&shy;
	certain
	cases
	like
	the
	preceding.&quot;
	


	In reality,
	all Perlman's
	cases and
	those cited
	above have
	in common the fact
	that no
	specific reference
	is  intended,  or,
	 in 
	most cases,  even
	possible; and
	the semantc
	feature {\itshape nonspecific
	}happens
	to be

	slurred
	by both
	generics and
	what Perlman
	calls &quot;indefinite
	singular.&quot; That he
	uses the
	word &quot;singular&quot;
	at all
	in this
	context is
	enough to
	show that
	he is
	looking at
	his data
	through English
	spectacles. English
	has an
	obligatory
	number distinction;
	every NP
	has to
	be either
	singular or plural.
	HCE does
	not have
	an obligatory number
	distinction, or
	rather it
	has three
	numbers-singular,
	plural, and
	nonspecific (number&shy;
	less). Thus,
	while to
	the English
	speaker {\itshape raesh
	}in
	/42/
	is clearly
	singular, while {\itshape dag
	}in /43/
	is clearly
	plural, HCE
	speakers treat
	both cases
	as unmarked
	for number,
	because both
	are nonspedfic:
	the rash,
	because no particular
	rash is
	being referred
	to-simply
	the usual
	consequence when
	the speaker
	uses a
	certain brand
	of soap;
	the dogs,
	because it
	was not one
	particular dog
	or group
	of dogs
	that gave
	the speaker
	trouble, but rather
	the business
	of dog-raising
	in
	general.
	


	We
	shall come
	back to
	nonspecifidty in
	each of
	the next
	three chapters; for
	the present,
	we only
	need to
	ask where
	the specific&shy;
	nonspecific, marked-unmarked,
	distinction that
	is incorporated
	in the HCE
	grammar came
	from. Based
	on the
	evidence already
	shown,  it could
	not have
	come from
	HPE. If
	HCE
	speakers had followed
	the Japanese version,
	they would
	have marked
	far fewer
	NPs than
	they do, and
	zero
	marking would
	have been
	assigned to
	at least
	some specifics.
	If they  had 
	followed the
	Filipino model, 
	thev<sub>,</sub><sub>
	</sub>would
	have had 
	far fewer
	<p class="western" align="justify" style="line-height: 0.14in">zeros,	 and 	some  definite 	articles  would 	have  been 	assigned  to	non&shy;	<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-right: 0.09in; margin-top: 0.01in; line-height: 104%">	specific NPs;	compare, for	instance, /30/	with /41/.	A	mixing strategy&shy;	&quot;Use more	articles than	Japanese HPE	speakers, fewer	than Filiplno	speakers&quot;-would have	achieved	roughly the	right  numerical 	propor\-tions	but, if	used alone,
	would hardly
	have arrived
	at  the rigorous
	semantic distinction
	that all
	HCE speakers
	in fact
	make.
	<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-right: 0.08in; text-indent: 0.42in; margin-top: 0.01in; line-height: 109%">	As the	influence of	the original	languages in	contact,	the glosses for	/36/-{43/	show that	English can	hardly have	been a	model. Of	the substrate	languages, many	do not	have articles	at all.	Of those that
	do, none
	show the
	same distribution
	of zero
	forms; Portuguese
	and Hawaiian
	allow, to
	a varying
	extent, zero-marked,
	number-neutral NPs in
	object position,
	but demand
	articles for
	subject generics
	like that  in 
	/36/.  Indeed,

	influence  might 
	note  that 
	the  speaker 
	who  produced 
	/36/,  even 
	after a generic
	with a
	definite article
	had been
	presented to
	him by
	his inter&shy;
	viewer, was
	a 79-year-old
	pure-blooded Hawaiian
	who had.
	spoken Hawaiian as
	a
	child.<sup>2</sup><sup>
	</sup>We must
	conclude, as
	with word
	order, that  the
	zero marking
	of nonspecifics
	was an
	HCE  &quot;invention,&quot;
	and one
	firmly rooted enough
	to override 
	counterevid.ence  from
	 other 
	languages known to
	its speakers.
	



	
	


	

	
	


	Next, let
	us examine
	verbal auxiliaries.
	HCE has
	an  auxiliary
	which marks
	tense, {\itshape bin
	}(which
	sometimes takes
	the form
	{\itshape wen,
	}derived from
	it by
	regular phonological
	rules); an
	auxiliary which
	marks modal&shy;
	ity, {\itshape go
	 
	}(sometimes 
	{\itshape gon)
	; 
	}and  an
	 auxiliary 
	which  marks 
	aspect, {\itshape stei.
	}I shall
	not discuss
	the first
	two here
	as we
	will return
	to a
	fuUer discus&shy;
	sion of
	creole
	tense-modality-aspect
	(henceforth TMA) 
	systems  in
	Chapter 2.
	The aspect
	marker {\itshape stei
	}will give
	us a
	clearer view
	of how creole
	creativity works.
	


	{\itshape Bin 
	}and {\itshape go
	
	}(at least
	as surface
	forms, though
	not with
	their HCE
	


	meanings) occur
	sporadically and
	unpredictably in
	.HPE,
	but {\itshape sti
	}does not-at
	least not
	as an
	auxiliary. It
	does,
	however, occur
	as a
	mam verb,
	taking locative
	complements:
	


	

	
	


	/44/   mi
	iste nalehu
	tu yia
	


	'I was
	in
	Nalehu for
	two years'
	


	

	
	


	Jn all
	our recordings
	of pre-1920
	immigrants (the
	only ones
	who could possibly
	have provided
	input to
	the creolization
	process) there
	were only seven
	sentences in
	which {\itshape stei
	}preceded
	another verb.
	When a feature
	that occurs
	so frequently
	in HCE
	occurs with
	such vanishing
	rarity in
	HPE, there
	clearly exists
	the possibility
	that it
	was invented
	by HCE speakers
	and was
	only afterward
	adopted by
	some HPE
	speakers\-who, as
	was suggested
	earlier, are
	hardly likely
	to have
	lived through
	a half-century without
	{\itshape any
	}addition
	to their
	grammars. But
	let
	us assume
	the contrary
	and ask,
	fu:st, whether
	the occurrences
	of {\itshape stei
	}represent
	


	\
	


	PIDGIN
	INTO
	CREOLE	27
	


	

	
	


	a true
	auxiliary,  or
	whether  the 
	sentences contain 
	mere  sequences of
	two main
	verbs; and
	second, whether
	uses such
	as
	these could
	have provided evidence
	for
	the HCE
	speaker to
	develop a
	true auxiliary
	with nonpunctual
	(progressive plus
	habitual) meaning.
	The seven
	sentences are:
	


	

	
	


	/45/  
	haus, haus
	ai stei
	go in,
	jaepan taim.
	


	/46/
	  
	al
	srei
	kuk.
	


	/47 /

	wrk had.
	


	/51/   samtaim
	wan dei
	stei gat
	twentipai baeg.
	


	

	
	


	I have
	not provided
	glosses since
	everything turns
	on what
	the sentences
	mean,. and
	what they
	mean is
	far from
	transparent. If
	/45/ were
	an HCE utterance,
	{\itshape stei
	go
	in
	}would mean
	something like
	'kept entering',
	


	which is
	improbable here;
	the .most
	likely meaning,
	in context,
	is that the
	speaker, when
	she was
	a girl
	in Japan,
	seldom used
	to leave
	the house. In
	the latter
	case, {\itshape stei
	}would be
	the main
	verb with
	the meaning
	


	'stay', while
	{\itshape go
	in
	}would
	probably have
	been learned
	as an
	undifferenti\-ated
	chunk meaning
	something like
	'inside'.
	In /46/,
	too, the
	second &quot;verb&quot;
	may not
	really be
	a verb
	either; {\itshape kuk
	}could
	represent the noun
	{\itshape cook,
	}in
	which case
	the sentence
	would mean
	simply 'I
	was a
	cook'. Sentence /47/
	could represent
	verb serialization
	as easily
	as auxiliary&shy;
	plus-verb; 'I
	stayed {\itshape 0J1d
	}helped
	my father'
	or 'l
	stayed {\itshape to
	}help my
	father' are
	as plausible
	as glosses,
	in context,
	as 'I
	was helping
	my father'. Sentences
	/48/ and
	/49/ could
	contain
	auxiliariesÂ·Â·Â·the
	reformu\-lation of
	/48/ makes
	it impossible
	to tell
	what was
	intended-but in
	both cases,
	punctual events
	are referred
	to; the
	most probable
	glosses are 'He
	drove up
	in
	his car'
	and 'My
	brother died
	here', respectively. But
	/49/ is
	puzzling since
	the Hawaiian
	verb {\itshape make
	}alone
	would mean
	'died', while
	{\itshape stei
	make
	}would mean
	literally 'is
	(or was)
	dead', which
	in conjunction with
	{\itshape here
	}makes
	little sense.

	A further
	difference  between
	 the
	HPE examples
	cited above
	and


	<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-right: 0.38in; text-indent: 0in; margin-top: 0in; line-height: 110%">	still less	the particular	rule that	they did	in fact	derive. But	if, as	is highly possible,	sentences such	as /45/-/51/	would not	have been	produced by	any HPE	speaker prior  to	1920,	and in	fact represent
	a case  of partial
	imperfect learning
	of HCE
	rules by
	those speakers
	(a
	<p class="western" align="justify" style="text-indent: 0in; line-height: 0.19in">	possibility  that	I shall	document  in	another 	area later	in this	chapter J,		then the	achievement of	the first	creole generation	becomes still	more mysterious, since	it must	have been
	completely ex
	nihilo.
	


	For if
	we look at
	the {\itshape stei
	+
	V
	}sentences of
	HCE speakers,
	we find
	<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-right: 0.39in; text-indent: 0in; margin-top: 0.02in; line-height: 110%">	no ambiguous	cases and	no reference	to single	punct ual	events. All their	uses of	{\itshape stei	}as auxiliary	fall into	what an	English speaker	would probably describe	as four	categories-present	continuous, past	con\-tinuous,	present habit
	ual, and
	past habit
	ual-but these
	four categories,
	as I
	have demonstrated
	elsewhere (Bickerton
	1975:Chapter
	2), really
	constitute a
	single nonpunctual
	category, semantically
	opposed to
	a punctual category
	expressing single
	nondurative actions
	or events:
	


	

	
	<p class="western" align="justify" style="line-height: 100%">/52/  	Present continuous:		ai no	kea hu	stei hant	insai dea,	ai gon	hunt		'l don't	care who's	hiinting in	there, I'm	going to

	/ 53/

	jaen  stei

	'While we
	were paddling,
	John was
	letting water
	into the
	canoe\-hey, the
	son-of-a-gun
	had sunk
	it!'
	


	he  many 
	hundreds  of
	{\itshape stei
	}sentences we
	recorded  from
	HCE speakers
	


	is that
	out of
	the seven
	examples, two 
	conjoined {\itshape stei
	}with
	predicates\-{\itshape gat
	}and {\itshape make-with
	}which it
	is never
	conjoined in
	HCE. This
	is because both
	are perceved
	as stative
	verbs, and
	in HCE,
	nonpunctual  aspec
	t cannot
	be applied
	to statives:
	{\itshape *shi
	stei
	no
	da
	ansa
	}is as
	ungrammatical as its
	English equivalent,
	{\itshape *she
	is
	knowing
	the
	answer.
	}It is
	true that
	on one
	of our
	glosses of
	/51/
	{\itshape gat
	}is not
	stative; but
	then it
	would  not  be
	used to
	express {\itshape collect
	
	}by  an 
	HCE speaker,  for
	whom {\itshape gat
	
	}is limited
	to an
	alternative form
	for {\itshape get
	
	}'have'.
	


	How
	
	could
	HCE
	speakers
	have
	invented
	the
	{\itshape stei
	+
	V
	}form?
	{\itshape Stei}
	


	is  common 
	as  a 
	locative  in 
	modern  HPE, 
	but  there 
	is some
	doubt
	


	:Whether it
	was so
	common at
	the time
	of creole
	formation. Examples
	m Nagara 
	(1972),
	drawn from
	data collected
	from very
	old speakers
	decade earlier,
	contain only
	{\itshape stap
	}as a
	locative, and
	the oldest
	speaker
	


	m ou:
	wn sur;ey,
	who arrived 
	prior  to
	
	1910, also 
	has only
	{\itshape stap.
	}Thus lt
	1s conceivable
	that even
	the locative
	use of
	{\itshape stei
	}was acquired
	by HPE
	speakers from
	HCE speakers.
	However, I
	would think
	it more likely
	that {\itshape stei
	}was a
	low-frequency variant
	around 1910
	and that
	HCE speakers selected
	it over
	{\itshape stap
	}because,
	semantically, {\itshape stei
	}was a
	more appropriate
	expression for
	durativity.

	gerund-which gave
	rise   first  to 
	the  form 
	{\itshape I'm 
	a-working 
	}(still  found
	in some
	conservative areas,
	e.g.,
	West Virginia)
	and then,
	via phono&shy;
	logical reduction
	and syntactic
	reanalysis, to
	the modern
	{\itshape Aux
	}+
	{\itshape V
	}+
	{\itshape ing.
	}These processes
	in English
	took several
	centuries to
	produce a
	result which HCE
	must have
	produced almost
	instantly.
	


	Again, we
	will look
	in vain
	for any
	substratum language
	which unites all
	the ingredients
	which make
	up HCE
	nonpunctual: preverbal
	free morpheme,
	semantic range
	inclusive of
	both progressive
	and habi&shy;
	tual,
	indifference to
	the past-nonpast
	distinction.
	Many substratum
	languages express 
	aspect via
	bound morphemes,
	or by
	reduplication (e.g.,
	Philippine languages-it
	is surely
	surprising, in
	view of
	the fre&shy;
	quency with
	which &quot;reduplication&quot;
	is hailed
	as a
	universal creole
	characteristic, that
	HCE speakers
	did not
	avail themselves
	of this particular
	resource!). Hawaiian
	uses free
	morphemes, but
	these are placed
	both before
	and after
	the verb;
	Chinese uses
	preverbal free
	morphemes, but
	semantically there
	is hardly
	any point
	of resemblance
	between the
	HCE and
	Chinese TMA
	systems. Perhaps
	the closest
	form to {\itshape stei,
	}semantically,
	is
	Japanese
	{\itshape -te
	iru/-te
	ita;
	}these
	forms cover (very
	roughly )
	the same
	semantic range as
	{\itshape stei.
	}However, it
	is the
	discontinuous  segment 
	{\itshape -te 
	i- 
	}which  carries
	 nonpunctual 
	meaning;
	


	{\itshape -ru
	}and {\itshape -ta
	}signify
	nonpast and
	past, respectively,
	and nonpunctuality
	cannot be
	marked without
	marking one
	or the
	other of
	them. Thus, the
	Japanese form
	satisfies neither
	the first
	nor the
	third characteristic
	of {\itshape stei.
	}To assume
	Japanese influence
	on {\itshape stei
	}would be
	to assume
	that a TMA
	system can
	be put
	together like
	a jigsaw
	puzzle;<sup>3</sup><sup>
	</sup>indeed, the
	implicit supposition
	that all
	languages are
	like erector
	sets which
	can be dismantled,
	cannibalized, and
	put together
	again in
	new combin,.,.
	tions lies
	at the heart
	of all
	substratum arguments.
	



	
	


	

	
	


	Our fourth
	area involves
	a particular
	type of
	sentential comple&shy;
	mentation. It
	has  already 
	been  mentioned 
	that  sentence
	embedding of any
	kind is
	virtually
	nonexistent in
	HPE. Certainly
	there are
	no examples  of 
	anything  resembling
	 English
	{\itshape for-to
	
	}complementat
	ion,

	HCE does
	have sentential 
	complements,  but 
	these are
	marked not 
	by {\itshape to
	}but by
	{\itshape fo
	}(presumably
	derived from
	English {\itshape for
	)
	}and
	{\itshape go;
	}the
	precise distribution
	of these
	will be
	discussed shortly.
	


	First, we
	must see
	what, if
	anything, HCE
	speakers could
	have learned from
	HPE. {\itshape Fo
	}is
	found in
	HPE only
	as a
	preposition, and
	it is rare
	even as
	a preposition
	in speakers
	who arrived
	prior  to
	
	the  late 1920s.
	{\itshape Go,
	}however,
	occurs frequently,
	and  in 
	three  contexts: 
	as  a main
	verb, as
	a marker
	of imperatives,
	and as
	a preverbal
	modifier of
	extremely indeterminate
	meaning and
	wildly fluctuating
	distribution (some HPE
	speakers use
	it before
	every third 
	or  fourth  verb; 
	others don't use
	it at
	all). The
	nearest antecedent
	to a
	complementizer {\itshape go
	}derives from
	its imperative
	use. One
	can have
	paratactic strings
	of imperative structures,
	 as in
	/59/:
	


	

	
	


	159{\itshape I
	 
	}go
	tek
	tu
	fala
	go
	{\itshape hapai
	}dis
	wan
	


	go take two
	men go
	carry this
	one 'Take two
	men and
	take this
	away'
	


	

	
	


	From their
	intonation contour,
	pauses, etc.,
	these are
	clearly two
	independen t
	sentences, but
	production of
	such sequences
	in the
	more rapid
	tempo of
	HCE could
	conceivably serve
	as a
	source of
	true comple&shy;
	mentation. Such
	a result
	might be
	even more
	likely in
	the case
	of reported imperatives,
	 such
	as /60/:
	


	

	
	


	/ 60/  
	ai no
	tel yu
	palas, go
	join pentikosta
	


	'I'm not
	telling you
	guys, &quot;Join
	the Pentecostal
	Church&quot; '

	with
	the
	benefit
	of
	the
	native
	English
	speaker's
	20/20
	hindsight.
	


	Apart   from 
	these   two 
	constructions-
	imperative  strings
	 and
	


	reported imperatives-there
	is nothing
	that looks
	remotely like
	a {\itshape goÂ·
	}complementizer
	construction in 
	HPE, and
	even these
	two are
	quite rare. There
	is thus
	no precedent
	far sentences
	such as
	the fallowing,
	which occur
	with considerable
	frequency in
	HCE:
	



	
	


	/61/   dei
	wen go
	ap dea
	erli in
	da mawning
	go plaen
	


	'They went up

	/62/    so
	ai go
	daun kiapu
	go push
	


	'So I
	went down
	to Kiapu
	TO
	push (clear
	land with
	a bulldozer)'
	


	/ 63/   
	ai gata
	go haia
	wan kapinta
	go fiks
	da fom
	


	'I
	had TO
	hire a
	carpenter TO
	fix the
	form'
	


	

	
	


	However, {\itshape Jo
	
	}often 
	replaces {\itshape go
	}in
	environments which
	might appear at
	frrst giance
	to be
	identical:
	


	

	
	


	/64/    aen
	dei figa,
	get sambadi
	fo
	push dem
	


	'And they
	figured there'd
	be someone

	/65/    mo

	'It would

	/66/    hau

	'How do
	you expect
	a guy
	TO finish
	his house?'
	


	

	
	


	In fact,
	the two
	sets of
	environments differ
	in an
	interesting way.
	The actions described
	in /61/-/63/
	all actually
	occurred, while
	those de&shy;
	scribed in
	/64/-/66/ were
	all
	hypothetical:
	there wasn't
	anyone to
	encourage the
	basketball team
	referred to
	in /64/;
	the speaker
	of /65/ hadn't
	gone to
	Honolulu; and
	the hypothetical
	{\itshape guy
	}in /66/
	couldn't complete his
	hypothetical house
	because the
	very real
	bank manager who 
	was being
	addressed wouldn't
	 issue
	a loan
	for that
	purpose. In

	other words,
	HCE marks
	grammatically the
	semantic distinction
	be\-tween sentential
	complements  which
	 refer 
	to  realized 
	events  and those
	which refer
	to unrealized
	events.
	


	The distinction
	is blurred
	a little
	by some
	sentences which
	contain both
	{\itshape Jo
	}and
	{\itshape go:}
	


	

	
	


	/67 /	pip!no
	laik tek
	om fo
	go wok 'People
	don't
	want TO
	employ him'
	


	/68/    rumach

	fiks om
	op
	


	'It's
	a lot
	of trouble, you
	see, TO fix
	it up'
	


	

	
	


	But again,
	these complements
	express hypothetical
	or even
	nonoccur\-ring
	events; thus,
	these examples
	confirm the
	claim that
	{\itshape Jo
	}only
	occurs with unrealized
	events, and
	does not
	affect the
	claim
	that {\itshape go,
	}ALONE, occurs
	only with
	realized events.
	


	In this
	area, then,
	HCE has
	made two
	distinct innovations,
	one semantic, one
	syntactic.  The 
	syntactic  innovation
	 consisted
	of  taking {\itshape Jo
	}and {\itshape go,
	}a
	preposition and
	an imperative
	marker, respectively,
	and using them 
	to  introduce 
	embedded  sentences,
	which were
	themselves an innovation.
	Even with
	the possible
	stimulus supplied
	by HPE
	sen\-tences such
	as /59/
	and /60/,
	this represents
	a massive
	change. However,
	the semantic
	innovation-
	distinguishing realized
	from unrealized
	com\-plements-was
	completely without
	precedent  in
	HPE, in
	English, or
	in any of
	the  substrate 
	languages.  We 
	should  bear 
	this  in 
	mind when we
	encounter widely
	separated creoles
	with identical
	distinctions in
	Chapter  2.<sup>4</sup>
	



	
	


	

	
	


	The fifth
	and final
	example of
	HCE innovation
	which  we will
	examine here
	is rather
	more complex
	than the
	previous examples,
	involving, as
	it does,
	the interaction
	of two
	rules: a
	rule of
	relativization and a
	rule of
	subject-copying. Each
	of these
	rules itself
	involves inno&shy;
	vation, but
	I shall
	say  little
	 about 
	these  since
	it is
	their  interaction
	that shows
	most dramatically 
	the working
	of creole
	creativity.

	Insertion of
	a pronoun
	between subject
	and predicate
	was noted above
	as a
	feature of
	Filipino HPE; this
	feature is
	discussed at
	length in
	Bickerton and
	Odo (1976:3.6.1).
	There is
	no  dear
	evidence  that 
	it
	is used
	as anything
	but a
	marker of
	verbal (as
	distinct from
	adjectival, nominal, or
	locative) predicates
	by  any 
	but  a
	small minority 
	of very late
	(post-1926) arrivals.
	However, HCE
	speakers use
	the same
	feature for all
	full-NP subjects
	on first
	mention and
	for all
	full-NP contrastive
	subjects; it
	follows from
	this that
	all
	full-NP subjects
	Â·of
	indefinite refer&shy;
	ence are
	thus marked
	(since indefinite
	reference  marks 
	first  mention
	only, and
	the {\itshape some
	guys
	}who {\itshape do
	
	X
	
	}turn
	into the  {\itshape they
	}or
	{\itshape those
	guys
	}who {\itshape do
	Y).
	}Thus,
	in HCE,
	sentences such
	as /69/
	and /71/
	are common,
	whereas /70/
	and /72/
	would be
	ungrammatical:
	


	

	
	


	/69/	sam gaiz
	samtaimz dei
	kam 'Sometimes
	some guys
	come'
	


	/70/    *sam
	gaiz samtaimz
	kam
	


	/71/  jaepan
	gaiz dei
	no giv a
	haeng, do
	


	'Guys from Japan
	don't give
	a hang,
	though'
	


	/72/    *jaepan
	gaiz no
	giv a haeng,
	do
	


	

	
	


	The function
	of pronoun-copying
	in HCE
	is dearly
	linked with
	that of the
	movement rules
	discussed above.
	All deal
	with constituents
	selected for special
	focus; movement
	rules move
	those constituents
	to the
	left, but subject
	NPs are
	already leftmost
	constituents  and
	can thus
	only be &quot;symbolically&quot;
	moved by
	inserting something
	between them
	and the rest
	of the
	sentence.
	


	Relative clauses,
	among pre-1920
	immigrants, are
	rare, and
	when they
	do occur,
	often they
	do so
	in forms
	influenced by
	the speaker's
	native language,
	cf. /14/
	above. Among
	HCE speakers,
	relative clauses
	are common.
	However, they
	differ from
	English relative
	clauses in
	that they contain
	no surface
	marker of
	relativization even
	where English
	demands one,
	i.e.,
	in sentences
	where the
	noun relativized
	on is
	sub\-ject
	of the
	clause, and
	either subject
	/73/ or
	object /74/
	of the
	main <b>sentence:</b>

	We will
	consider
	how such
	sentences may
	be generated
	in Chapter
	2.
	


	The interaction
	of those
	two rules
	comes about
	when full
	NPs of indefmite
	reference and
	other NPs
	which must 
	be  copied 
	{\itshape occur 
	}as head nouns
	of relative
	clauses and
	subjects of
	those clauses.
	In non&shy;
	relative sentences,
	such as
	/69/ or
	/71/, the
	copy either
	immediately follows the
	NP, as
	in /71/,
	or, if
	an adverb
	is present, as
	in /69/,
	immediately precedes
	the verb. 
	In
	relative-clause 
	sentences, however,
	the copy
	must follow
	the entire
	relative clause:

	this were
	the case,
	the subject
	of /73/, which

	would be

	More\-over, a

	(All but

	copied onto it.)
	A few
	speakers might
	have, in
	addition, a
	rule for
	relativization that would
	simply replace
	NP by
	S. HCE

	/110/

	The A-0ver-A
	principle, or
	whatever general
	constraint governs
	the subject-copying rule
	in
	relativized
	sentences, would
	not need
	to  be separately stated
	 in 
	the  HCE 
	grammar  since 
	it  would 
	presumably be a
	universal.
	


	All that
	remains for
	us is
	to ask
	how these
	quite substantial
	innovations could
	have been
	produced.  There
	would seem
	to be
	only two logically
	possible  alternatives.
	 They 
	could  have 
	been  produced by
	some kind
	of general
	problem-solving device
	such as
	might be applied
	in any
	field of
	human behavior
	where the
	required human
	institutions were
	lacking-much as
	survivors of 
	a  shipwreck 
	or  an atomic
	holocaust might
	reconstruct government,
	laws, and
	other social
	institutions. Or
	they might
	have been
	produced by
	the  operation 
	of innate faculties
	genetically programmed
	 to 
	provide  at 
	least  the
	basis for an
	adequate human
	language.
	


	If Hawaii
	were the
	only  place where
	people had
	been. faced with
	the problem
	of reconstructing
	human language,
	it would
	be impossible to 
	decide  between 
	these  alternatives.
	 However, 
	Hawaii is far
	from unique.
	There are
	a number
	of creole
	langnages in
	other. parts of
	the globe,
	but produced
	under very similar
	circumstances, several of
	which have
	been described
	well enough
	to make
	compatison possible. It
	is true
	that in
	these cases
	we do
	not have
	the antecedent
	pidgin for
	compatative purposes,
	<sup>5</sup><sup>
	</sup>but we
	shall see
	that there
	are still some
	oblique indications
	of antecedent
	structure. In.
	any case,
	it
	is difficult
	to see,
	given the
	rapidity with

	very diversity of
	the world's
	languages shows,
	and we
	would expect
	;o
	f'.&quot;d that, given
	the differences
	in geographical
	region, culture,
	contnbut:&quot;g
	languages, and
	so on,
	each group
	faced with
	the task
	of reconstructrng
	language would
	arrive
	at quite
	different soltions.
	Indeed: unles
	I am
	mistaken, orthodox
	generativists,
	even while
	believing m
	an innate
	language faculty,
	might predict
	the same
	result since
	their thery
	assigns to
	that faculty
	nothing more
	than those
	formal and
	substantive universals
	which are
	reflected in
	all languages.
	Thus, they
	could pre&shy;
	dict no
	more of
	a creole
	than that
	it should
	not violate
	any universal
	constraint.
	


	However, if
	all  creoles could
	be shown
	to exhibit 
	an identity far
	beyond the
	scope of
	chance, this
	would constitute
	strong eidence
	that some
	genetic program
	common to
	all members
	of the
	species was
	decisively shaping
	the result.

	<b>CREOLE</b>
	



	
	



	
	



	
	



	
	



	
	


	Although similarities
	among creoles
	have been
	known to
	exist at least
	since the
	pioneering work
	of Schuchardt
	and others
	in the latter
	half of
	the 19th
	century, it
	was not
	until the
	middle of
	the present century
	that articles by
	Taylor (1960,
	1963, etc.),
	Thompson (1961),
	Whinnom (1956,
	1965),
	and others
	began to
	spell out
	these similarities in
	any detail.
	Curiously, their
	pioneering efforts
	were not
	systematically developed;
	in general,
	creolists continued
	to describe
	individual creoles,
	or (much
	more rarely)
	groups of
	creoles with
	a common superstratum
	(e.g.,
	Goodman 1964,
	Hancock 1970,
	Alleyne 1980),
	or else
	simply
	used already
	existing data
	in long-drawn,out
	and essentially fruitless
	debates on
	issues such
	as monogenesis
	versus poly&shy;
	genesis, or
	substrate versus
	superstrate influence
	(Bickerton [1976]
	provides a
	brief summary
	of these).
	


	While the
	profession badly
	needs a
	volume that
	would systema&shy;
	tically compare
	all the 
	well-known  creoles,
	 such 
	a task 
	lies beyond the
	scope of
	the present
	volume. Instead,
	I shall
	look at
	general creole
	patterns in
	the five
	areas covered
	in the
	last chapter,
	plus some
	other areas, to
	give a
	rough general
	picture which
	should enable
	us to
	deter\-mine  how
	 far 
	they,  and 
	HCE,  resemble
	one another;
	and I
	shall then

	explore in
	greater depth
	two areas-verb-phrase
	.complementation and
	the syntax
	and semantics
	of TMA
	systems-which
	have already
	been treated
	by various
	writers more
	extensively than
	other areas.
	We should then
	be in
	a position
	to answer
	the questions
	posed at
	the end
	of the
	


	previous chapter.	.  
	.
	


	Before embarking
	on this
	task, however,
	1t is
	necessary  to
	say
	


	a few
	words about
	some of
	the peculiar
	problems it
	involves. One set
	of problems
	arises from
	the limitations
	of man
	existing escriptions
	of creoles.
	No creole language
	has yet
	been provided
	the kmd of
	com\-prehensive and
	detailed reference
	grarnma that
	is taken
	for granted in
	most areal
	fields.
	With too
	few exceptions,
	creole grammars
	tend to
	stop where
	the syntax
	gets interesting,
	e.g.,
	&quot;complex sentences&quot;
	are often
	dismissed with
	a page
	or two
	of unanalyzed
	examples. For many
	creoles, only
	outline sketches
	are available.
	Morovr,
	some descriptions
	may be
	based on
	incorrect data
	or contam
	mcorrect analyses. As
	for tbe
	two creoles
	that l
	know best-Guyanese
	reole and
	Hawaiian Creole
	English-I
	must regretfully
	state that
	I fmd
	all previous
	descriptions deficient
	or misleading
	in a
	number f
	respects.
	


	It might
	be argued
	here that
	it is
	premature to begm
	a:&quot;Y general
	or theoretical
	work, especially
	one of
	a novel 
	or controverSlal 
	nature, until these
	lacunae have
	been filled
	and these
	errors amended.
	For instance, Corne
	(1977
	:2)
	states: &quot;Questions
	about the 
	'genesis'  of 
	t.he
	creole languages,
	their genetic 
	relations  with 
	each  other 
	&quot;':'d .w.1th
	their source
	language(s), the
	processes  of 
	creolisation  (and
	p1dgm1:5a&shy;
	tion)  cannot 
	be  approached  
	seriously   unless
	 we  
	know   somethmg
	abou the
	object being
	talked about,
	and that
	we shall
	not know 
	(in sufficient detail)
	until  a lot
	more of
	the  unglarnourous
	 drudgery 
	of careful descriptive
	work has
	been completed.&quot;
	This statement
	shows a
	profound misunderstanding
	 of
	the ways
	in which 
	cience is
	developed and knowledge
	increases. Empirical
	knowledge is
	no guarantee 
	of certitude, and
	its absence
	no barrier
	to  insight; 
	I  would 
	oppose,  to Corne,
	the following
	statement  by 
	Dingwall  (1979:3):
	  &quot;Relying  o.n
	logical argument
	alone, Leucippus
	was able
	to  develop 
	the  atomic
	theory,  while 
	Aristotle,  able 
	to  rely,
	on  the 
	results  of 
	numerous  dis-

	sections, failed
	to discover
	the correct 
	function of
	the brain
	, imagining it
	to be
	the cooling
	system of
	the body.&quot;
	


	The view
	that rheorists
	are  mere grandstanding
	prima donnas,
	while the
	real work
	of the
	trade is
	done by
	the modest 
	empirical plodder, is
	a widespread
	misconception in
	creole studies
	that merely
	underlines the
	immaturity of
	the field.
	In the
	real world,
	unglamorous drudges never
	artive at
	that moment
	of revelation
	which is
	always, like the
	rainbow, just
	beyond the
	next  bend. 
	For  them,
	it's always
	&quot;a
	little too
	early to
	judge&quot;; the
	data are 
	&quot;not 
	yet  all
	in.&quot; They 
	bequeath  to their
	successors no
	more  than 
	mountains  of 
	fact, which 
	may or
	may not  contain 
	the  nuggets 
	that  would 
	genuinely  enrich 
	us; more 
	often, I suspect,
	the latter,
	since the  facts
	one can
	gather about
	any language are
	infinite in number,
	and by
	no means
	all of
	equal value.
	What is needed
	is not
	dogged fact-gathering
	 (with 
	or without 
	moral sermons) but
	the capacity
	to distinguish 
	between  the
	trivial and
	the nontrivial.
	The task
	of the
	theorist is
	to tell
	the field
	worker where
	to look
	and what to
	look for,
	and if
	the latter
	chooses  to
	reject  such
	aid, he
	has about as
	much brain
	as the
	man who
	throws away
	his metal
	detector and proceeds
	to dig
	by hand
	the three-acre
	field where
	he  thinks
	treasure lies
	buried.
	



	
	


	

	
	


	Another problem
	in creole
	studies is
	the question
	of how
	to interpret differences
	among creoles,
	where they
	genuinely exist.
	Are we to
	assume that
	any and
	every difference
	must be
	given equal
	weight? Such an
	assumption would
	be naive,
	as I
	shall try
	to show.
	


	Creoles are
	the nearest
	thing one
	can find
	to ab
	ovo creations
	of language, but
	they are
	not  and
	cannot be 
	purely  ah
	ovo  creations. At
	the very
	least, pidgins
	provide some
	input to  them,
	and this,
	even if deficient,
	even if
	sometimes rejected,
	as we
	saw, is
	still input.
	Since pidgins show
	clear  substratum 
	differences,  and 
	since the
	composition of substrata
	differs from
	place to
	place, that
	input must
	also be
	a variable, which
	must somehow
	be factored
	out if
	we are
	to determine the
	extent to
	which  creoles
	are genuinely
	creative.


	


	

	


	


	46	<sup>ROOTS</sup><sup>
	</sup><sup>OF</sup><sup>
	</sup><sup>L</sup><sup>A</sup><sup>'</sup><sup>t</sup><sup>&lt;GUAGE</sup>					But there	is	another variable	in pidgins	that may	have more	far-reaching consequences	than differences	in  the 
	pidgin  substrata:
	that is,
	the extent
	of superstrate
	influence on
	the pidgin.
	This in
	turn will depend
	on ratios
	of superstrate
	to nonsuperstrate
	speakers; if
	the former are
	numerous, there
	will  be 
	more  superstrate 
	features  avail&shy;
	able to
	the first
	creole generation.
	We have
	already noted
	the case
	of Reunion. But
	there are 
	some areas
	in which 
	population  ratios
	during the pidginization
	stage are
	unknown; hence,
	even if
	we exclude
	known cases
	like Reunion,
	this variable
	cannot be
	entirely eliminated.
	More\-over, factors
	other than
	demographic may 
	influence  it. 
	Population ratios in
	Hawaii  differed little
	from those
	in the
	Caribbean, but
	the (relative) freedom
	of an
	indentured as
	opposed to
	a slave
	society
	must have
	had some
	effects on
	the quantity
	and quality
	of linguistic
	inter\-action, and
	may well
	explain why
	we find 
	more  English 
	features in both
	HPE and
	HCE than
	we do
	in a
	creole like
	Sranan, or
	even in
	the basilectal
	varieties of
	Guyanese or
	Jamaican Creole.
	


	Other problems
	arise from
	the operation
	of linguistic
	change processes, be
	those processes
	internal or
	contact produced.
	


	Internal changes
	affect languages
	regardless  of 
	their  ancestry,
	and one
	would imagine
	that creoles,
	by the
	very recency
	of their emergence
	from rudimentary
	pre-pidgins, would
	be more,
	rather than less,
	subject to
	such changes
	than more
	developed languages.
	The oldest creoles
	have a
	time depth
	approaching five
	hundred years,
	which is
	certainly adequate
	for a
	number of
	significant
	changes to
	have taken place;
	but in
	most cases
	the absence
	of written
	records from earlier
	periods, and
	the  unreliability
	 of 
	such  records 
	where  they 
	do  exist\-not
	necessarily the
	fault of
	the witnesses,
	since these
	were Europeans,
	and code-switching
	presumably existed
	in the
	17th
	century as
	it does
	today-makes 
	it  difficult  
	indeed  to 
	estimate  the 
	extent   and 
	nature of
	such changes.
	<sup>1</sup>
	


	However, in
	addition to
	internal change
	there is
	the contact&shy;
	stimulated type
	of change
	known  as 
	decreolization.  This
	can  affect any
	creole which
	has remained  in
	contact
	with its
	superstrate, as
	most have. 
	Decreolization  is
	 well 
	docu!ll,ented  fur
	 some 
	English  creoles
	


	CREOLE<sub>	</sub><sub>4</sub><sub>7</sub>
	


	(DeCamp 1971,
	Bickerton  1973a,
	1975),
	but  has
	been  largely 
	ignored in studies
	of other
	creoles. Valdman
	(1973)
	suggests that
	it is
	equally widespread
	among French
	varieties,
	and its
	presence in
	Cabo Verdiense
	and some
	other Portuguese
	creoles is
	quite apparent.
	The result
	of decreolization is
	to create
	a continuum
	of  intermediate
	varieties be&shy;
	tween creole
	and superstrate.
	If this
	process is
	sufficiently long
	and intense, the
	continuum may
	be progressively
	eroded at
	its creole
	end. The result
	may be
	a synchronic
	state in
	which the
	most conservative
	variety recoverable
	is already
	considerably different
	from (and
	con\-siderably closer
	to the
	supersttate than)
	the original
	creole; this
	is obvious in
	some cases,
	e.g.,
	Trinidad, but
	may be
	less so
	elsewhere.
	


	Again, in
	some cases
	where truly
	conservative varieties
	are recoverable,
	researchers may
	have failed
	to unearth
	them (the
	obser\-vations
	of Bailey
	[1971]
	on the
	texts in
	Le
	Page and
	DeCamp  [1960
	) are very
	relevant here).
	To compare
	a partially 
	decreolized  creole
	with a nondecreolized
	one can
	only produce
	an appearance  of
	difference which might
	not have
	existed had
	it been
	possible to
	compare the
	two languages in
	their  pristine 
	condition. Yet,
	given  present 
	uncertainties as to
	which creoles
	have decreolized,
	and how
	much, this
	trap is
	one into which
	the most
	careful scholar
	might inadvertently
	fall.
	


	A field
	so fraught
	with possible
	sources of
	error might seem
	to provide the
	comparativist with
	an inexhaustible
	source of
	alibis. Faced with
	any apparent
	difference, he
	could say:
	&quot;Well,
	this must
	be due
	to one or
	another of
	these interfering
	factors, so
	let's
	just forget
	it!&quot; Any
	such procedure
	would turn
	the inquiry
	into a
	farce, and
	yet, in
	light of the
	foregoing paragraphs,
	it would
	be equally 
	irresponsible  to 
	take every difference
	 at
	its face
	value and
	accord equal
	weight  to
	each. lf,
	as indicated
	in Chapter 
	1,
	there is
	some unique,
	creative force
	at work in
	the formation
	of creoles,
	we must
	try to
	distinguish this
	from other forces
	that might
	interact with
	it and
	serve to
	mask it.
	But unless
	we can show
	precisely {\itshape which
	}factor
	is involved,
	{\itshape why
	}it
	should have
	taken
	


	effect, and  {\itshape how
	}it
	could have
	worked to
	provide the
	observed results,
	our efforts
	will be
	valueless.























	


	48	ROOTS
	OF LANGUAGE
	


	

	
	


	A final
	problem concerns
	the weighing
	of evidence
	and the criteria
	for making
	judgments. This
	is of
	particular importance
	when we come
	to deal
	with apparent
	cases of
	substratum influence.
	


	Claims of
	substratum influence
	still persist
	strongly in
	creole studies and
	are made
	in such
	recen t
	works as Jansen,
	Koopman and
	Muysken (1978),
	Alleyne (1979,
	1980),
	etc. However,
	substrato\-maniacs,
	if
	I may
	give them
	their convenient
	and  traditional  name,
	seem to
	be satisfied
	with selecting
	particular structures
	in one
	or more creole
	languages and
	showing that
	superficially similar
	structures can be
	found in
	one or
	more West
	African languages
	(at least
	one careful study,
	Huttar [197
	5] ,
	has shown
	that  such
	structures are
	not  always as
	similar as
	they might
	appear at
	first glance).
	This may
	be just
	as well; if
	they pursued
	their  inquiries 
	any  further, 
	they  would 
	find that not only
	would they
	have to
	confront some
	rather serious
	diffi\-culties, but
	that even
	if they
	overcame these,
	they  would,
	perforce, wind up
	in a
	position which
	is only
	a step
	away from
	that which
	is proposed here.
	


	Let us
	suppose that
	a very
	common structure
	in Caribbean
	creoles is
	also attested
	for Yoruba
	and perhaps
	one or
	two other
	rela\-tively minor
	languages (this 
	case is
	not hypothetical;
	we shall
	meet with it
	in the
	very next
	section). To
	most substratomaniacs,
	the mere existence
	of such
	similarities constitutes
	self-evident proof
	of the connection.
	They seldom
	even consider
	the problem
	of transmission.
	How does
	a rule
	get from
	Yoruba into
	a creole?
	


	Theoretically, there
	are several
	,possibilities. One
	at least-some
	kind of
	monogenetic ancestor
	which would
	have taken
	structure from
	Yoruba and
	other languages
	and passed
	it on
	to a
	wide range
	of descen&shy;
	dents-has
	been proposed
	many times,
	but no
	body of
	evidence (save
	for just
	those creole
	similarities it
	purports to
	explain!)
	has ever
	been presented
	for such
	a language,
	and until
	one is,
	we can
	safely ignore
	it. Consequently, we
	must assume
	that our
	rule, and
	perhaps others,
	passed from
	Yoruba into
	the antecedent
	pidgin s
	of a
	number of
	creoles, and thence
	into those
	creoles. For
	this to
	have happened,
	a substantial
	number of
	Yoruba speakers
	must ha.;'e
	been present
	during the
	pidgin
	


	CREOLE<sub>	49</sub>
	


	

	
	


	phase in
	each area,
	or at
	least no
	later than
	the earliest
	phase of
	creoli&shy;
	zation. If
	not, if
	a substantial
	number did
	not arrive
	in  a
	given  area until
	after the
	creole had
	been formed,
	then previous
	speakers would
	hardly abandon
	the  rules they
	themselves  had arrived
	at and
	replace them with
	new rules,
	unless the
	number of
	Yoruba was
	so great
	as to co.nstitute
	an absolute
	majority-and that,
	to the
	best of
	present knowl-
	edge, was
	never true
	at any
	time for
	any Caribbean
	territory.2

	it would
	be difficult,
	if not impossible,
	to prove
	that there were
	{\itshape no
	}Yorubas
	in any
	given area
	at the
	time of
	creolization, there are
	a number  of
	areas where
	their presence
	must have
	been heavily outweighed
	by members
	of other
	groups. If
	we take
	Sara\-maccan, for
	instance, generally
	regarded as
	the most
	African-like of
	creoles, we
	find very
	few lexical
	survivals even
	from the
	whole Kwa group
	(of which
	Yoruba is
	a member)
	but very
	many from
	Bantu lan&shy;
	guages, in
	particular Kikongo
	(Daeleman 1972).
	One would
	think that the
	frrst task
	in constructing
	any substratum
	theory would
	be to
	show that the
	necessary groups
	were in
	the necessary
	places at
	the necessary
	tirnes; But
	this has
	simply not
	been done.
	


	There are
	linguistic as
	well as
	historical problems
	to be
	faced by any
	serious substratum
	theory. As
	things
	stand, we
	are asked
	to believe that
	different African
	languages contributed
	different rules
	and features to
	particular creoles.
	To accept
	that this
	is possible
	is to
	accept what
	Dillard(l 970),
	in a
	slightly different
	context, aptly
	termed the
	&quot;Cafe&shy;
	teria Principle.&quot;
	Dillard was
	arguing against
	the once
	widespread belief
	


	tat
	creoles were
	mixtures of
	rules and
	features from
	various regional
	dialectsof the
	British Isles. But
	if
	it is
	absurd to
	suppose that
	a creole could
	mix fragments
	of Irish,
	Wessex, Norfolk,
	and Yorkshire

	to suppose

	Akan, Igbo,
	Mandinka, and
	Wolof-to mention
	some of
	the African
	languages which
	substratomaniacs most
	frequently invoke.
	


	Let us
	suppose, however,
	that such
	miracles were
	possible, and that
	Yoruba speakers
	were indeed
	distributed in
	such a
	way that

Nobody	can deny	that, in	every case,	there were	many other	African languages	involved in	each area,	and nobody who	knows  anything about	African languages	can deny	that, even within	the Kwa	group-and a
	fortiori outside
	it-there
	are wide
	differences in
	rules and
	rule systems.
	What  could
	be so
	special about a
	particular Yoruba rule
	(such as
	the one
	for verb-focusing
	which we will
	shortly discuss)
	that would
	cause it
	to be
	accepted over
	all compe&shy;
	titors in
	a number
	of different
	and quite
	Â·separate
	groups?
	


	This 1uestion
	has been
	raised with
	respect to
	one feature
	which is by
	no means
	limited to
	Yoruba:
	verb-serialization. In
	their analysis
	of this
	phenomenon, Jansen,
	Koopman and
	Muysken (1978),
	while accepting
	the standard
	substratum explanation,
	wonder why
	it is
	that creoles,
	with their
	dear preference 
	for  features 
	that  are unmarked
	in
	the Jakobsonian
	sense, should
	have selected
	one which
	is quite
	rare among the
	world's languages,
	and highly
	unstable (subject
	to rapid change)
	even in
	those that
	have it.
	They are
	unable to
	provide an answer,
	although I
	shall suggest
	one in
	the latter
	part of
	this chapter.
	


	In a
	general sense,
	we can claim
	that the
	only possible
	factor that could
	lead a
	group to
	accept a
	particular rule
	out of
	a set
	of alternatives must
	have to
	do with
	the emerging
	system of
	the language which
	that group
	is engaged
	in developing.
	It could
	only be  that
	, at any
	given stage
	in that
	development, the
	language could
	only incorpor&shy;
	ate rules
	of a
	certain type,
	and would
	have to
	reject others.
	Although we still
	know far
	too little
	about dynamic
	processes in
	language to
	be able to
	say what
	such constraints
	on development
	might be
	like, we
	can be reasonably
	certain that
	they exist.
	Languages, even
	creoles, are
	systems, systems
	have structure,
	and things
	incompatible with
	that structure cannot
	be borrowed;
	SVO languages
	cannot borrow
	a set
	of post positions,
	to take
	an extreme
	and obvious
	case. If
	a marked
	struc\-ture is
	incorporated (and
	if
	verb-serialization
	is highly
	marked, then
	verb-focusing is
	super-highly marked)
	, it
	can only
	be because
	the language, at
	that particular
	stage of
	its development
	, has
	to have
	some
	


	such rule.
	


	That  a 
	creole  language 
	has  to 
	have  certain 
	types  of 
	rules  is
	


	'
	


	CREOLE<sup>	51</sup>
	


	

	
	


	exactly what
	the present
	study is
	designed to
	prove. If 
	such  rules happen
	to be
	present in
	the input
	in certain
	cases, that  is
	in no
	way counter to
	the theory
	expressed here;
	the  creole 
	will  acquire 
	such rules,
	not because
	they are
	in the 
	input,  for
	many  conflicting
	rules must
	be there
	also, but
	because  such 
	a rule 
	is required
	by the
	struc\-ture of
	the emerging
	language. Indeed,
	presence in
	the input
	may not even
	be a
	necessary, let
	alone a
	sufficient, condition
	since the 
	first creole generation
	could well
	have devised
	such a
	rule for
	itself; we
	saw in the
	first chapter
	that that
	generation can
	and does
	invent  rules
	without benefit
	of experience.
	But even
	if we
	accept the
	entire sub&shy;
	stratum case,
	the situation
	is not
	substantively changed;
	the first
	creole generation has
	merely acquired
	the kind
	of rule
	that it
	was programmed
	to acquire,
	and saved
	itself the
	trouble, so
	to speak,
	of having
	to invent
	something equivalent.
	Thus, when
	taken to
	their logical
	conclusions, substratum
	arguments only
	bring us
	back to
	the question
	this book
	will
	try to
	solve: why
	do  creole 
	speakers  acquire 
	some types
	of rule,
	but not others?
	



	
	


	

	
	


	With these
	points clarified,
	we can
	now survey
	some key
	areas of grammar
	and see
	something of
	the range
	and extent
	of the
	similarities which any
	creole theory
	must somehow
	account for.
	



	
	


	

	
	


	{\itshape Movement
	
	Rules}
	


	HCE, as
	we have
	seen, moved
	focused constituents
	to sentence&shy;
	initial position.
	The same
	procedure, with
	some modifications
	which I shall
	discuss in
	a moment,
	is
	followed by
	all other
	creoles.
	


	It is
	sometimes suggested
	that  there is
	nothing very
	remarkable about this
	fact, since  many
	languages have
	similar processes.
	But it
	is also true
	that  many 
	languages  have 
	also,  or
	instead, other 
	methods of marking
	focus, such
	as changes
	in stress
	or tone
	patterns, or
	the use of
	focusing particles.
	The fact
	that  creoles
	have adopted 
	none of
	these

I	shall illustrate	the Caribbean	strategy from	Guyanese Creole	(GC), since	this language	seems to be
	typical in
	all respects.
	


	Let us
	start with
	a simple
	declarative sentence
	such as
	/1/:
	


	

	
	


	/1/	Jan
	bin sii
	wan uman 'John
	had seen
	a woman'
	


	

	
	


	The subject
	can be
	focused by
	adjoining the
	equative copula
	{\itshape a
	}to the
	first NP:
	


	

	
	


	/2/     a
	Jan bin sii
	wan uman
	


	'It
	was John
	who had
	seen a
	woman'
	


	

	
	


	The object can
	be focused
	by moving
	the NP
	to sentence-initial
	position and again
	adjoining {\itshape a:}
	


	

	
	


	/ 3/     
	a wan
	uman
	Jan bin
	sii
	


	'It was
	a woman
	that John
	had seen'
	


	

	
	


	Other VP
	constituents such
	as oblique-case
	NPs and
	adverbials can
	be focused in
	an identical
	manner. However, the
	verb can
	also be
	focused by a
	rather different
	procedure; it
	is again
	preposed and
	{\itshape a
	}is adjoined
	to it,
	but a
	copy is
	obligatorily left
	at the extraction
	site:
	


	

	
	


	/4/     a
	sii Jan
	bin sii
	wan uman
	


	

	
	


	There is
	no exact
	equivalent to
	/4/ in
	English; it
	is roughly
	equivalent to 'John
	had {\itshape seen
	}a woman'
	or 'John
	 had 
	{\itshape really 
	}seen  a
	woman'  or 'Seen
	a woman,
	that's what
	John had
	done'. In
	English ,
	it is
	impossible to
	apply a movement
	rule to
	V alone;
	English movement
	rules apply to
	major categories,
	and major
	categories in
	English are
	NP and
	VP.
	


	This  fact 
	must  immediately 
	raise  doubts 
	about  the 
	status  of
	


	'
	


	<sup>CREOLE</sup>	53
	


	

	
	


	VP in
	GC, for
	while NP
	and V
	can be
	moved freely,
	VP cannot:
	



	
	


	/5/

	/6/

	Note that
	/6/
	without {\itshape a
	}and with
	appropriate lexical
	and phonological
	changes would
	be grammatical
	in
	HCE:

	<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-right: 0.08in; text-indent: 0.41in; line-height: 110%">	One difference	between GC	and HCE	could then	be due	to the fact	that the	latter  has	the  category 	VP  while 	the  former 	does  not. VP	has  always	been a	problem for	generative grammar;	many scholars	


	have
	been unwilling
	to accept
	it as
	a universal
	category since
	(among
	


	other things)
	it
	is hard
	to posit for
	VSO languages
	where it
	would be
	a discontinuous
	constituent in
	deep structure.
	I know
	of no
	rule
	in GC
	for which
	VP has
	to
	be specified in
	the structural
	description (GC
	does not have
	the equivalent
	of English
	VP deletion,
	for example).
	


	However, this
	seems like
	a pretty
	massive difference
	to begin
	our list
	of
	similarities with.
	If creoles
	are constrained
	by
	a genetic
	program, how could
	things like
	this possibly
	come about?
	


	If, as
	will be
	claimed in
	Chapter 4,
	the original
	building blocks of
	language are
	just NPs
	and Vs,
	then VP
	is not
	a primitive
	constituent, but V
	is; thus,
	in the
	earliest stages
	of a
	creole, I
	would predict
	that V, but
	not VP,  would
	be a
	category. However,
	either as
	a result
	of de&shy;
	creolization, involving
	contact with 
	a language 
	which  already 
	has VP as
	a category,
	or of
	internal change,
	a creole
	can develop
	VP.
	



	
	


	

	
	


	Previously, we
	established that
	superstrate influence
	was one
	of the factors
	which would
	disrupt natural 
	creole development,
	whether that   influence
	  came  
	during  pidginization
	  or, 
	much   later, 
	through
























	


	54	ROOTS
	OF LAA
	GUAGE
	


	

	
	


	decreolization. That
	the results
	of influence
	at these
	two points
	can be virt
	ually identical
	and impossible
	to disentangle
	is testified
	by the
	elo\-quent bafflement
	of Corne's
	comments on
	the status
	of  Reunion
	Creole (Corne
	1977
	:223-24).3
	
	For 
	instance,  as
	mesolectal  varieties
	of GC
	come under
	English influence,
	they develop
	VP. Now,
	it seems plausible
	to suppose
	that HCE,
	which, as
	we have
	seen, was
	influenced by English
	more strongly 
	than  most
	other English 
	creoles, acquired
	VP at
	birth, rather
	than two
	or three
	hundred years
	later (though 
	I would agMe
	that for
	the moment
	there is
	no obvious
	way to
	prove this). If
	this is
	so, then
	HCE would
	not be
	typical of
	the most
	natural creole
	development; but
	the overall
	theory would
	be unaffected,
	since Washabaugh's
	( 1979)
	claim that
	any
	genetically-programmed
	feature should appear
	universally in
	creoles, irrespective
	 of other
	conflicting factors, is
	a blatant
	straw man.
	


	However, we
	still have
	to show
	why GC
	copies the
	verb. Here, the
	hypothetical case
	of the
	Yoruba rule
	discussed in
	the preceding
	section becomes
	real, for
	Yoruba does
	indeed have
	a rule
	that yields
	sentences very
	similar to,
	although not
	identical
	with /4/.
	At first
	sight this
	rule looks
	so weird
	that one
	thinks (I
	myself thought
	for several years)
	that direct
	borrowing must
	be the
	only possible
	source. However,
	consider for
	a moment
	what would
	happen if
	GC had
	a rule
	which said, &quot;Move
	all major
	categories&quot;
	(probably
	true of
	any human lan&shy;
	guage), plus
	a condition 
	which  specified 
	that major
	categories were NP
	and V
	(which is
	highly probable
	based on
	the evidence),
	but this movement
	did
	NOT leave
	a copy
	of V
	at the
	extraction site.
	


	Such a
	rule would
	separate verbs
	from their
	auxiliaries, and
	this would immediately
	cause severe
	processing problems
	for speakers
	of creoles. It
	is a
	condition on
	transformations generally
	that meaning
	be recoverable, but
	since a
	number of
	auxiliaries (e.g.,
	GC {\itshape go
	)
	}are
	hornoph\-onous
	with full
	verbs or
	can modify
	zero copulas,
	and since
	many full verbs
	are homophonous
	with the
	nouns derived
	from them,
	sentences in which
	only V
	is fronted
	could wind
	up with
	meanings completely
	different from
	those they
	originally had.
	Take the
	following examples:
	


	

	
	


	'
	


	<sup>CREOLE</sup>	55
	


	

	
	


	/10/   Jan
	bin go
	wok a
	haspital
	


	'John
	would have
	worked at
	the hospital'
	


	/11/
	
	*a
	wok
	{\itshape Jan
	bingo
	a
	haspital}
	


	

	
	


	The italicized
	main clause
	in /11/
	constitutes a
	complete sentence
	with the
	meaning 'John
	had gone
	to the
	hospital'. Since
	{\itshape wok
	}can be
	noun or verb,
	and since
	nouns are
	fronted without 
	copying, as
	in /2/
	and
	


	/3/, /11{could
	be, and
	almost certainly
	would be,
	interpreted as
	'It was work
	that John
	had gone
	to the
	hospital for'.
	Again, if
	V-fronting minus
	copying were
	applied to /
	1/
	above, it
	would yield:
	


	

	
	


	/12/  
	*a sii
	Jan bin
	wan uman
	


	

	
	


	This couldonly be
	interpreted as
	a (slightly
	ungrammatical) version
	of 'He (or
	I) saw
	that John
	was a
	woman!' Thus,
	if a
	copy is
	not left, meaning
	is irrecoverable.
	It would
	seem, therefore,
	that any
	language with movement
	rules that
	involve V
	only, rather
	than VP,
	MUST de\-velop
	a copying
	rule (or
	if, as
	has often
	been suggested
	in the
	literature, movement
	rules normally
	consist of
	two parts,

	constituent,  it 
	must   then 
	merely  suppress 
	the  second 
	half of the
	process). No
	borrowing from
	any other
	language would
	be required. Moreover,
	a claim
	that GC
	borrowed the
	tule from
	Yoruba setS&quot; up
	an infinite
	regress: where
	did Yoruba
	borrow it
	from? It
	is much more
	Â·.plausible
	to suppose
	that languages
	independently invent
	rules when these
	are demanded
	by the
	structure of
	the language
	plus func&shy;
	tional requirements.
	


	The other
	difference between
	GC and
	HCE rules
	involves the
	use of an
	equative copula.
	HCE could
	not use
	such a
	copula because
	it never  developed
	 one.
	Absence  of 
	an  equative 
	copula seems
	to be
	


	characteristic of
	those languages
	(e.g.,
	HCE, Crioulo,
	the Indian
	Ocean creoles[IOC]
	) which
	show heavier
	superstrate influence,
	but as
	there is
	no plausible
	mechanism here 
	to  show 
	WHY  that 
	influence  should
	have this
	effect (positive

	another),  we 
	must   note 
	this  as 
	a  potentially  
	significant   difference.
	In the
	absence of
	such a
	focus-marking device,
	some other
	morpheme must be
	recruited, and
	creoles seem
	to have 
	no  specific 
	program  for
	either source
	or position:
	Crioulo {\itshape ki
	}is
	drawn from
	a
	superstrate rela&shy;
	tivizer (Pg.
	{\itshape que)
	}and
	postposed to
	the extracted
	constituent; Seychelles
	Creoles {\itshape sa
	}is
	drawn from
	its
	own definite
	article, in
	turn  derived 
	from Fr. fa,
	and optionally
	preposed; while
	HCE uses (for
	subject NP)
	the quasi-obligatory
	verb-predicate marker
	fortuitously present
	in Filipino
	versions oâ¢
	HPE, post
	posing it
	and adding
	number and
	gender. This
	diversity is
	in sharp
	contrast to
	the generality
	of left
	movement, and
	suggests (we
	will later
	provide abundant
	evidence, not
	just from
	creoles but from
	child language
	acquisition) that 
	the  genetic 
	program  which
	prod uces
	language in
	the species
	highly specifies
	some areas
	of language and
	leaves others
	undetermined;  this is
	only to
	be expected,
	as a
	genetic blueprint which
	leaves no
	room for
	variation and
	development would
	freeze a
	species at
	a
	single
	developmental level.

	There seems,
	in contrast,
	to be
	hardly any
	variation at
	all in
	the way that
	creoles handle
	articles. Virtually
	all
	creoles
	have a
	system iden&shy;
	tical to
	that of
	HCE: a
	definite article
	for presupposed-specific
	NP; an indefinite
	article for

	Corne  does

	assume  that these
	too are
	treated as
	nonspecifics.
	


	Similar illustrations
	could be
	produced for
	almost any
	creole. This area
	of grammar
	seems to
	be highly
	specified in
	creoles; the
	dis\-tinction between
	specific and
	nonspecific is
	particularly clear
	and consistent, and
	when we 
	look  at
	language  acquisition
	in Chapter

	find confirmatory
	evidence that
	it is

	{\itshape Tense-Modality-Aspect
	(TMA)
	Systems}
	


	A majority
	of creoles,
	like HCE,
	express tense,
	modality, and
	aspect by
	means of
	three preverbal
	free morphemes,
	placed (if
	they co-occur) in
	that order. I
	have already
	discussed the
	typical creole
	system elsewhere
	(Bickerton 1974;
	197
	5:Chapter 2),
	so here
	I shall
	give only a
	brief  outline, returning
	later in
	the chapter
	to  go much
	more deeply into
	some apparent
	counterexamples which
	have been
	men\-tioned in
	the literature.
	


	In  the 
	typical  system-which
	 HCE 
	shares with 
	GC,  Sranan
	(SR), Saramaccan  (SA),
	 Haitian  Creole 
	(HC), and
	a number 
	of other
	creoles\-ranges  of
	 meaning 
	of  the 
	particles  are
	identical:  the
	tense  particle 
	ex\-presses 
	[+Anterior]   (very
	roughly, past-before-past
	 for
	action verbs
	and past   for
	. stative 
	verbs) ;s  
	the  modality 
	particle  expresses
	  [+Irrealis]
	(which   includes 
	 futures 
	and   conditionals);
	 while  
	the   aspect  
	particle expresses  
	[+Nonpunctual]  
	(progressive-durative 
	plus habitual-iterative).
	The  stem 
	form  in 
	isolation  expresses 
	the  unmarked 
	term in
	these three
	oppositions,   i.e.,  
	present   statives
	 and  
	past   nonstatives.
	  In  
	addition, there  exist
	 combined 
	forms,  some 
	of  which 
	in  some 
	languages  have
	been  eroded 
	(in GC
	by  phonological 
	rules, in
	HCE by 
	decreolization) ,
	but  of
	which  the 
	full set
	is attested 
	for HC
	(Hall 1953)
	and SR
	(Voor\-hoeve   
	1957).  
	Again,   wherever 
	  combined  
	forms   are  
	present,   their
	meaning  is 
	the  same: 
	anterior  plus 
	irrealis,  counterfactual
	 conditions; anterior 
	plus nonpunctual, 
	past-before-past 
	durative or
	habitual  actions;
	irrealis   plus  
	nonpunctual,    habitual
	  or  
	durative   unrealized
	  actions; anterior 
	plus  irrealis 
	plus  nonpuncti,:al,
	 counterfactuals 
	which  express
	duration  or
	habituality.
	


	CREOLE	59
	


	

	
	


	Surface
	forms,
	of
	course,
	take
	a
	number
	of
	different
	shapes:
	anterior,
	GC
	{\itshape bin,
	}SA
	{\itshape bi,
	}SR
	{\itshape hen,
	}HC
	and
	Lesser
	
	Antillean
	
	Creole
	(LAC)
	{\itshape te;

	GC
	{\itshape sa/go,

	{\itshape o,

	{\itshape sa,

	{\itshape ta,
	}SR
	{\itshape e,
	}HC
	{\itshape ape,
	}LAC
	{\itshape k
	a.}
	


	HCE, with
	{\itshape bin,
	go,
	}and {\itshape stei,
	}shares even
	two of
	the GC
	surface forms, although
	the two
	languages are
	several thousand
	miles apart
	and their speakers
	have never
	been in
	contact. Combined
	forms have
	almost disappeared
	through decreolization,
	but are
	retained by
	a few
	speakers (Bickerton
	1974),
	and/or
	are attested
	for earlier
	periods (Reinecke
	1969,
	Tsuzaki 1971),
	although nowadays
	those who
	remember them are
	so unsure
	of what
	they once
	meant that
	one investigator
	(Perlman 1973)
	accused his
	consultants of
	making them
	up! (See
	discussion in
	Bickerton 1977:183ff.)
	Thus, we
	can again
	claim a
	highly programmed
	area, and
	many details
	of the
	ways in
	which children
	acquire quite
	different kinds
	of TMA
	systems (see
	Chapter 3,
	below) will
	serve to confirm
	this claim.
	



	
	


	

	
	


	{\itshape Realized
	and
	Unrealized
	Complements}
	


	What work
	has so 
	far  been 
	done  on 
	creole  complementation
	has focused
	largely on
	verb serialization,
	so data
	on this
	topic are
	extremely scarce. 
	However, all
	the
	languages for
	which I
	have been able
	to find
	good data 
	attest  an 
	identical  structure
	 to 
	that  of 
	HCE, i.e.,
	complementizers which
	are selected
	by the
	semantics of
	the em\-bedded
	S.
	


	Roberts (197
	5) reports
	the following
	contrast from
	Jamaican Creole
	(JC):
	


	

	
	


	/27 {\itshape I
	 
	}im gaan
	fi bied, bot
	im duon
	bied
	


	'He went
	to wash,

	/28/	*irn
	gaan
	go
	bied,
	bot
	irn
	duon
	bied
	


	

	
	


	Here, {\itshape go
	
	}as
	complementizer  cannot
	 co-occur with
	a negative
	conjunct because  its
	 meaning 
	expresses  a
	realized  action.
	However, {\itshape fi
	}is
	fully

	Jansen, Koopman
	and Muysken
	(1978) report
	an identical
	con\-trast
	in Branan:
	


	

	
	


	/29/    a
	teki a
	nefi foe
	koti a
	brede, ma
	no koti
	en
	


	'He took
	the knife
	to cut
	the bread, but
	did not
	cut it'
	


	/30/   *a
	teki a
	nefi koti
	a brede,
	ma no
	koti en
	


	

	
	


	Here, the
	contrast is
	between {\itshape foe
	
	}and {\itshape (/)
	}as
	complementizers, but
	{\itshape the}
	


	semantic distinction
	is identical.<sup>6</sup>
	


	The examples
	so far
	have all
	been from
	English creoles
	although it is
	obvious
	that the
	distinction cannot
	have been
	derived from
	a lan&shy;
	guage which does
	not make
	it:
	


	

	
	


	/31/
	
	{\itshape I
	managed
	to
	stop
	}(entails
	&quot;I
	stopped&quot;).
	


	/32/
	 
	{\itshape Ifailed
	
	to
	stop
	}(entails
	&quot;I
	did
	not
	stop&quot;).
	


	{\itshape /

	I
	went

	Mary

	I34/
	 
	{\itshape I
	went
	to
	see
	Mary
	but
	she
	wasn't
	home.}
	


	

	
	


	Fortunately for those
	who might
	still hypothesize
	some occult
	English influence, the
	same contrast
	is found
	in Mauritian
	Creole (MC).
	In one of
	the texts
	in Baker
	(1972),
	we find
	/35/:
	


	

	
	


	/35/	Iidesid
	al
	met posoh
	ladah she
	decide go
	put fish
	in-it
	


	'She decided
	to put
	a fish
	in (the
	pool)' A line
	or so
	later, /36/
	follows:
	


	/36/   Iidon
	posoh-la en
	ti noh-gate
	


	she give
	fish-the one
	small nickname
	'She gave
	the fish
	a little
	nickname'
	


	\
	


	CREOLE<sup>	61</sup>
	


	

	
	


	In
	other
	words, she
	had indeed
	done what
	she decided
	to do,
	i.e., put a
	fish in
	the pool.
	The al-complement,
	therefore, indicates
	a realized action.
	However, in
	another text
	we find
	/37/ :
	


	

	
	


	/37 {\itshape I
	
	}Iiti
	pe ale
	aswar pu
	al hril
	lakaz sa
	garsoh-la

	'He would
	have gone
	that evening
	to burn
	the hoy's
	house, but
	on the
	way he
	was attacked
	by witches'
	


	

	
	


	Here, the
	subject of
	the sentence
	was prevented
	from carrying
	out his intention
	by the
	witches; accordingly,
	the complement 
	is marked
	with {\itshape pu
	al
	}Since
	Baker does
	not discuss
	this construction,
	we have
	no way
	of knowing if,
	as I
	suspect, /38/
	would be
	ungrammatical in
	that particular  
	context:
	


	

	
	


	/38/  Iiti
	pe ale
	aswar al
	bril lakaz
	. .
	.
	


	

	
	


	However, all
	realized complements
	in Baker's
	texts are
	marked with
	{\itshape al}
	


	or
	{\itshape (/)
	,
	}and
	all
	unrealized
	complements
	are
	marked
	with
	{\itshape pu
	}or
	{\itshape pu
	al.}
	


	These similarities,
	not previously
	pointed out
	in any
	published work, are
	particularly striking
	in that
	the structure
	looks like
	a highly marked
	one, being
	attested in
	few if
	any
	noncreole languages;
	and yet the
	identity is
	not merely
	semantic and
	syntactic; it
	extends even to
	the choice of
	lexical items-for
	{\itshape pu
	}derives
	from Fr.
	{\itshape pour

	and Eng.

	}While
	it is

	of genetic

	no historical or

	there is

	explanation  than 
	one  based 
	on the 
	possession,  by 
	speakers in 
	all four areas,
	of some
	quite specific
	program for
	language-building.
	



	
	



	
	


	{\itshape Relativization
	
	and
	
	Subject-Copying}
	


	In these
	areas there
	exist certain
	differences. Most
	creoles have
	relative pronouns,  at
	least when
	the head-noun  is
	also subject
	of the relative
	clause, but
	HCE does
	not. However,
	the time
	that most
	creoles have had
	to gain
	relative pronouns
	is
	little less
	than the
	time it
	took English to
	gain them
	in this
	position (Bever 
	and Langendoen 
	1971).
	If creoles
	were indeed
	born without
	surface relativizers,
	then the
	same processing problems
	that Bever
	and Langendoen
	discuss would
	have applied
	to them,
	and there
	would have
	been a
	similar pressure
	to borrow
	or adapt
	some feature
	that would
	serve to
	avoid such
	problems.
	


	However, any
	such speculation
	would be
	pure conjecture,
	if it
	wereÂ· not
	for the
	fact that
	in a
	number of
	creoles there
	still exist
	con\-servative
	dialects or restricted
	sentence types
	in which
	relative pronouns
	are deletable
	in subject
	position-or rather,
	more probably,
	were never
	inserted. In
	GC, for
	instance, this
	can happen
	when the
	head-noun of the
	relative clause
	is the
	object of  the
	higher sentence
	and when
	the main verb
	of that
	sentence is
	an equivalent
	of {\itshape have
	}or {\itshape be
	}(the regular
	GC relative
	pronoun is
	{\itshape we):}

	Corne (1977:38)
	gives some
	examples of
	relative clauses
	in SC
	where, also,
	the head-noun
	is object
	of the
	main clause,
	and where
	no rela&shy;
	tivizer is
	present on
	the surface:
	


	

	
	


	/41/ 
	iana
	Born Lulu
	i d!lse
	deor
	


	PM there-is
	good-guy wolf

	ASP wait same
	'They see
	the poor

	Again, although
	in general
	the Portuguese
	creoles of
	the  Bight 
	of Benin have
	relative pronouns,
	Valkoff  (1966:97)
	 reports  a
	conserva\-tive
	dialect of
	Annobones which
	lacks them:
	


	

	
	


	/43/	me mu
	gogo na-mina
	sa gavi mother
	my like
	PL-child be
	good
	


	'My mother
	likes the children
	who are
	good'
	


	

	
	


	Thus, although
	there is
	no proof
	that creoles
	started without
	relative pronouns,
	the possibility
	cannot be
	ruled our.
	Moreover, as
	we shall
	see later,
	a rather
	indirect argument
	based on
	grammatical sim&shy;
	plicity points
	in the
	same direction.
	


	From what
	we have
	already seen
	of movement
	rules, we
	would not expect
	to find
	much similarity
	in the
	area of
	subject-copying. This,
	at least initially;
	is some
	kind of
	focusing
	device, and
	we saw
	that other
	creoles have
	means for
	focusing which
	employ other
	features. However,
	there are
	at least
	two creoles,
	Crioulo (CR)
	and SC,
	which have
	a form
	{\itshape i
	}that
	characteristically occurs
	between  subject 
	and predicate,
	but is
	also the third
	person singular
	subject pronoun
	in both
	cases. Clearly,
	what\-ever
	function this
	form may
	originally have
	had, it has
	now become
	obligatory in
	certain contexts;
	for instance,
	it  serves
	to mark
	present tense nonverbal
	predicates, i.e.,
	it functions
	as a
	kind of
	copula:
	


	

	
	


	/44/   CR:
	elis iamiigu
	


	they PM
	friend 'They are
	friends'
	


	/45/   CR:
	iamiigu
	


	he friend
	


	'He is

	Ishall
	not explore
	the meanings
	and functions
	of this
	particle since
	Wilson (1962),
	practically the
	only source
	for CR,
	does not
	provide adequate
	data, while
	at the
	other extreme,
	Corne (1974-75)
	and (1977)
	presents masses
	of data
	on the
	SC form
	and shows
	that its
	complexities will
	not yield
	easily to
	analysis. In
	any case,
	the principal
	point that was
	made with  regard
	to HCE
	was not
	specifically to
	do with
	either relativization or
	subject-copying.
	


	We  saw
	in Chapter
	1 that
	when the
	subject of
	the higher
	clause is also
	subject of
	the relative
	clause, the
	subject-copy pronoun
	follows the  relative
	 clause 
	rather  than 
	the  subject  noun,
	although  elsewhere
	it directly
	follows the
	subject noun-as
	{\itshape i
	}does in
	 /46/, 
	for  example,
	Now, in
	both CR
	and SC,
	in other
	words in
	the only
	two creoles
	in which we
	could look
	for an
	analogue of
	the HCE
	structure (since
	they are the
	only ones
	with anything
	like a
	subject copy),
	we fmd
	that in
	subject-subject
	relative-clause
	sentences, ifollows
	 the 
	relative  clause
	and not
	the noun
	subject, i.e., 
	it also
	obeys the
	A-over-A  principle
	orits equivalent 
	(examples from
	Wilson  1962:30;
	Corne 1977
	:53):
	


	

	
	


	/48/  CR: 
	3mi k
	bay awnti
	iriba
	


	man who
	go yesterday
	PM return
	


	'The man
	who went
	yesterday has
	returned'

	that old
	man 'The only
	farmer that
	I can
	go and
	fool is
	just that
	old man'
	


	

	
	


	Moreover, these
	are not
	the only
	cases where
	the A-over-A
	principle  applies
	to 
	creoles: the
	placement  of
	HC articles

	clause sentences
	is
	also

	the HC

	{\itshape la }immediately
	follows the
	noun: {\itshape chwal-la
	}'the horse',
	{\itshape k
	apten-na
	}'the captain'.
	However, if
	the noun
	is head-noun
	of a
	relative clause,
	the definite article
	follows that
	clause, i.e.,
	it
	is
	adjoined to
	 the
	higher rather than
	the lower
	NP:

	We have
	now surveyed
	the five
	areas which
	were discussed
	in Chapter 1
	and found
	that in
	three of
	them (articles,
	TMA markers, and
	realized /unrealized
	complements) the
	&quot;innovations&quot;
	made by
	the original speakers
	of HCE
	were identical
	with the
	equivalent forms and
	meanings in
	all or
	most creoles,
	while in
	the remaining
	two there were
	broad, general
	similarities
	along with
	some differences
	in detail.
	It is
	worth noting
	that the
	similarities are
	most striking
	where a
	combi\-nation of
	semantic and
	syntactic factors
	interact; where
	purely syn&shy;
	tactic rules
	are involved,
	as with
	movement rules
	and relativization,
	there is
	a lesser
	degree of
	identity. Why
	this should
	be so
	will be
	ex&shy;
	


	plained in
	Chapter 4,
	fn.
	15.
	


	I shall
	now, much
	more briefly,
	indicate some 
	other areas
	in which  strong
	creole  resemblances
	 can 
	be found,
	before proceeding
	to a more 
	thorough  analysis
	 of
	TMA  systems
	and VP
	complemen tation.
	



	
	


	

	
	


	{\itshape Negation}
	


	In creoles
	generally, nondefmite
	subjects as
	well as
	nondefinite VP
	constituents must
	be negated,
	as well
	as the
	verb, in
	negative sen&shy;
	tences. Examples
	are from
	GC and
	Papia Kristang
	(PK):
























	


	<sub>6</sub><sub>6	</sub>ROOTS
	OF LAt'IGUAGE
	


	/52/	non
	dag na bait
	non kyat 'No
	dog bit
	any cat'
	


	/53/	ngka
	ng'koza nte
	mersimentu not no-thing
	not-have value
	'Nothing has any
	value'
	


	

	
	


	Sentences of
	this kind do
	occur occasionally
	in HCE,
	e.g.:
	


	

	
	


	/54/	nowan
	no kaen bit
	diz gaiz 'No
	one can
	beat these
	guys'
	


	

	
	


	However, while
	negated VP
	constituents
	are common,
	negated subjects
	with negative
	verb are
	rare, perhaps
	because of
	persecution in
	the
	schools.
	



	
	


	

	
	


	{\itshape Existential
	and
	Possessive}
	


	Over a
	wide range
	of creoles,
	the same
	lexical
	item is
	used to
	express existentials
	(&quot;there is&quot;)
	and possessives
	(&quot;have&quot;),
	even though
	this is
	not true
	of any
	of the
	superstrates (it
	may be
	true of
	some substandard
	Portuguese dialects
	of Brazil,
	but these
	may well
	be de&shy;
	creolized remains
	of an
	earlier
	creole). Examples
	are from

Adjec&shy;	tives are	surface verbs	in creoles	(see next	section) and	therefore require	no copula.	Locatives are	introduced by 	verbs which	normally are	limited to	that role,
	i.e., do
	not extend
	to existential
	or prenominal
	environments. A
	split
	occurs over
	treatment of
	nominal complements:
	the more
	heavily 
	superstrate-influenced 
	creoles  (HCE, 
	the  Indian Ocean
	creoles, some
	Asian Portuguese
	creoles) tend
	to have 
	zero copulas here 
	also,  although
	in some
	(SC, CR)
	the {\itshape i
	}form
	appears here as
	a predicate 
	marker;  the
	less heavily 
	superstrate-influenced 
	creoles of the
	Caribbean generally
	have a
	distinct verb
	in these
	envitonments.
	


	There are
	minor exceptions
	to
	these
	generalizations. GC
	locative
	


	{\itshape de 
	}can  express
	 existentials, 
	which  HCE
	{\itshape stei, 
	}for example,
	 cannot:
	


	

	
	


	/60/

	'There isn't

	/61/    *wok

	/62/   nomo

	'There isn
	't any work'
	


	

	
	


	HCE and
	SC have
	negative
	existentials-nomo and
	{\itshape napa-a
	}feature
	found in
	few if
	any other
	creoles which,
	in the
	HCE case
	at least,
	represents an
	inheritance from
	the antecedent
	pidgin. The
	locative {\itshape ye
	}in HC
	appears only
	sentence-finally, Le.,
	where it
	is
	stressed,
	which,
	together with
	its phonetic
	shape, suggests
	that it
	disappeared from
	medial position
	through phonological
	reduction
	processes.

	Although some of
	these differences
	may arise
	from pidgin
	retentions or
	post-creolization
	changes, it
	would seem
	that the
	copula area is
	only moderately
	specified. There
	is a
	general tendency
	toward semantic
	transparency, i.e.,
	having separate
	forms for
	each semantically
	distinct copula
	function (attribution,
	with adjectives;
	equation or
	class membership, with
	predicate nominals;
	locative, with
	adverbials of
	place). However,
	since these
	semantic distinctions
	are unambiguously
	marked by
	predicate type,
	to mark
	them a
	second time
	with distinc&shy;
	tive copulas
	may seem
	redundant, and
	perhaps this
	accounts for
	copula variability within
	individual
	creoles as
	well as
	across the
	class.
	



	
	


	

	
	


	{\itshape Adjectives
	as
	Verbs}
	


	In a
	number of
	creoles (e.g.,
	JC, Bailey 
	1966; GC,
	Bickerton 197
	3) the
	adjective has been
	analyzed as
	forming a
	subcategory of
	stative verbs.
	Evidence from
	GC is
	the identical
	behavior of
	verbs and
	adjectives under
	a number
	of rules:

	Originally, all
	writers on
	the Indian
	Ocean creoles who
	dealt with this
	area (Baker
	1972;
	Corne 1973,
	1977;
	Papen 1975,
	 1978;
	Bollee 1977;
	etc.) treated
	verbs and
	adjectives as
	distinct classes
	and posited
	an underlying copula
	before predicate
	adjectives, which
	was subsequently
	deleted. However,
	in an
	insightful article, Corne
	(1981)
	renounces his
	former analysis
	and sets
	up a
	class of
	&quot;Verbals,&quot;
	which would
	contain predicate
	adjectives as well
	as verbs
	and which
	would not
	require a copula 
	in  underlying 
	structure;  these 
	&quot;verbals&quot; would
	 then 
	undergo at least
	some (Corne
	seems hesitant
	to push
	his argument
	too hard)
	of the processes
	which verbs
	undergo. It
	is worth
	noting that
	some of
	the evidence Corne
	surveys bears
	a striking
	resemblance  to
	that  found
	in GC, in
	particular the 
	&quot;inchoative&quot;
	meaning  of
	the nonpunctual
	marker {\itshape pe
	}when
	applied to
	adjectives, as
	compared to
	the meaning
	of the
	GC nonpunctual marker
	{\itshape a
	}when similarly
	acquired; compare
	the following with
	/66/ :
	


	

	
	


	/71/  
	Iipe
	malad
	


	he ASP
	sick
	


	'He is
	getting sick'
	


	/72/   Iipe
	a-koler
	


	'He is
	getting angry'
	


	{\itshape 17}3/
	  m6
	pe lafe
	


	'I am getting
	hungry'
	


	

	
	


	This resemblance
	between creoles
	so widely
	separated in
	location and
	origin is
	quite striking.
	Moreover, I
	know of
	no creole
	where an
	alterna\-tive
	analysis of
	adjectives would
	be required.
	HCE, not
	surprisingly, has
	a similar
	&quot;inchoative&quot;
	sense when
	nonpunctual and
	adjective  are
	conjoined:
	


	

	
	


	/74/    ho,
	ai stei
	wail wid
	da meksikan

	Papen does
	not state
	whether, in
	his estimation,
	one set
	is older
	or more creole
	than the
	other (failure
	to make
	any serious
	attempt to
	sort variants is
	a grave
	weakness in
	the otherwise
	thorough work
	done recently on
	Indian Ocean
	creoles), but 
	we  can 
	be  reasonably 
	certain that the
	periphrastic forms
	represent the
	original creole;
	if the
	quasi\-French  forms
	existed already,
	why should
	others have
	been invented?
	


	Since HPE
	speakers acquired
	the full
	set of
	English question&shy;
	words except
	for {\itshape why
	}(HPE {\itshape wasamata,
	}lit., 'What's
	the matter?',
	which seems not
	to have
	been passed
	on to
	HCE), HCE
	was never
	required to
	develop a
	bimorphemic set.
	However, the
	similarities  above
	 are 
	so close that
	we can
	predict that
	any creole
	which did
	not borrow
	directly from its
	superstrate would
	develop a
	set of
	forms along
	these lines.

	We have
	now surveyed
	seven areas
	of the
	grammar in
	addition to the
	five already
	examined in
	greater depth.
	Of those seven,
	HCE shows
	substantial identity
	with all
	other creoles
	in four
	(existential/
	possessive, adjective as
	verb, questions,
	and passive
	equivalents); substantial
	iden\-tity with
	a number
	of other
	creoles in
	one (copula);
	and little
	simi\-larity in
	two (negation,
	question-words). Thus,
	out of
	the twelve
	areas, HCE is
	identical with
	all or
	with a
	large percentage
	of creoles
	in eight, shows
	a fair
	degree of
	similarity in
	two, and
	differs sharply
	in two, one
	of which
	(negation) may
	well have
	followed the
	regular creole
	pattern before
	decreolization set
	in.
	


	This degree 
	of  identity 
	is quite
	remarkable when
	we consider
	


	that HCE
	shares none
	of the
	substratum languages
	of the
	other creoles&shy;
	


	'
	


	CREOLE<sub>	73</sub>
	


	

	
	


	except that
	a superstrate
	language for
	some creoles was
	a substrate
	language in
	HCE, i.e.,
	Portuguese! However,
	there is
	nothing in
	the grammar of 
	HCE  except 
	perhaps {\itshape stei
	
	}as locative
	 that 
	one  can 
	point to as
	having stemmed
	from Portuguese 
	influence.  The 
	only  thing HCE
	seems to
	have in
	common with.other
	creoles (apart
	from the
	simi\-lar social
	conditions that
	gave birth
	to them)
	is that
	all have
	European superstrates, a
	fact which
	has been
	used to caution
	creolists against
	premature universalist claims
	(Reinecke 1977).<sup>9</sup><sup>
	</sup>However,
	since practi&shy;
	cally all
	the common
	features of 
	creoles  are 
	not only
	not shared
	by, but run
	dead counter
	to the
	structural  tendencies
	 of,
	Western  Euro&shy;
	pean languages
	(the latter
	have well-established
	single copulas,
	well\-established
	passives, use
	subject-verb or
	subject-auxiliary
	inversion in
	questions, etc.),
	no one could
	invoke this
	shared ancestry 
	to explain creole
	similarities unless
	he were
	to propose
	that creoles,
	like naughty
	children, do 
	everything  the 
	opposite  of 
	what  their 
	parents  tell 
	them to do!
	


	However, an
	earlier work
	of mine
	(Bickerton 1974)
	that was limited
	to a
	discussion of
	TMA systems
	has been
	the subject
	of  a number
	of  criticisms, 
	several  to  the 
	effect  that 
	there  were 
	a number of
	exceptions to
	the generalizations
	made therein.
	I shall
	therefore deal
	with the
	issues raised
	in the most
	cogent and
	extensive of
	these criti&shy;
	cisms, namely,
	Muysken (1981a),
	before going
	on to
	show that
	all the
	genuine divergences
	from the 
	classic TMA 
	pattern  can
	be  accounted for
	by the
	impingement on
	that pattern
	of three
	factors. Two
	of these factors
	are quite
	extraneous and
	have already
	been discussed:
	influence of the
	antecedent pidgin
	and language
	change. A
	third will
	have to
	wait until Chapter
	4 for
	a full
	explanation; for
	the time
	being, let
	us call
	it <b>&quot;indeterminacy</b><b>
	</b><b>in</b><b>
	</b><b>semantic</b><b>
	</b><b>space.&quot;</b>
	


	Muysken challenges
	my analysis
	of creole
	TMA systems
	by evidence drawn
	from six
	languages: Papiamentu,
	Negerhollands, Senegal
	Kriol, Seychellois,
	Tok Pisin,
	and Siio
	Tomense. Data
	from two
	of these are
	quite irrelevant
	to the
	issues involved.
	Tok Pisin
	has already
	been ruled as
	having arisen
	under circumstances
	so vastly 
	different  from
	those  of 
	the  classic 
	creoles that 
	the fact
	that it
	is now

	native language-hence,
	nominally a
	creole-has
	no bearing
	on the
	present discussion.
	Senegal Kriol
	is described
	by Muysken
	himself as an
	&quot;inter-tribal
	lingua franca
	which may
	have had
	native speakers
	in the past
	and which
	has some
	recent ones
	now in
	urban areas&quot;;
	since he
	himself is
	forced to
	admit that
	this checkered
	history may have
	&quot;given it
	a very
	marked, deviant
	character,&quot; one
	wonders why 
	he should have
	bothered to
	present data
	from it.
	


	Negerhollands is,
	or  rather
	was, a
	genuine creole
	in the
	terms of this
	study, but
	there are
	at least
	two reasons
	why evidence
	drawn from it cannot
	stand up
	against evidence
	from languages
	which  are still vital.
	First, the
	language is
	dead; one has
	to rely
	entirely on
	printed sources. This
	may not
	present a
	genuine obstacle
	to the
	writing of
	grammars of
	classical languages,
	but the
	case of
	creoles is
	quite dif&shy;
	ferent. If
	one takes
	the  text 
	of  a
	Hittite  law
	or a
	Sanskrit  prayer,
	one can
	be reasonably
	certain that
	it was
	written by
	a native
	speaker; if one
	takes any
	text of
	Negerhollands, one
	can be
	certain that
	it was not
	written by
	a native
	speaker. As
	with virtually
	all other
	creoles, texts-whether
	they take
	the form
	of fact
	or fiction,
	catechism or
	simulated dialogue-were 
	written  by 
	Europeans,  with 
	all  the 
	biases of
	their time
	and without
	any special
	linguistic skills
	or training.
	Many of the texts
	were written
	by missionaries,
	who are
	notorious for
	pro\-ducing
	Europeanized varieties
	of pidgins 
	and  creoles
	wherever  they
	go (Voorhoeve
	1971).
	This is
	not to
	say that
	a European,
	even a
	Euro\-pean
	missionary, could
	not on
	occasion
	accurately represent
	a creole.
	The problem
	is knowing
	when a
	creole {\itshape is
	}being
	accurately represented.
	


	For example,
	there is
	one excellent
	literary source
	for  GC:
	Quow (1877).
	It is
	too
	excellent, if
	anything, because
	it gives
	several stylistic
	levels without
	the facts
	that might
	enable one
	to sort
	them out. There
	are also
	a number
	of other
	sources, of
	widely varying
	quality. If I
	had had
	to write
	a GC
	grammar from
	written sources
	only, there
	is no way
	that I
	could have
	learned to
	prefer Quow
	whenever he
	is in
	conflict with
	other evidence;
	that knowledge
	came from having
	four years of
	unrestricted access
	to native
	speakers.<sup>1</sup><sup>0
	</sup><sup>
	</sup>Consequently, 
	my work would
	have seriously
	misrepreseted
	the language.
	


	CREOLE<sub>	</sub><sub>7</sub><sub>5</sub>
	


	The second
	reaso11 against
	using Negerhollands
	as evidence
	for any general
	creole tendency
	is
	that although
	languages, like
	people, die, they
	do not,
	like 5ome
	people, drop
	dead. On
	the contrary,
	like Charles II,
	they are
	an unconscionable
	time a-dying,
	and since
	we know that
	in
	language
	death languages
	become severely
	distorted, but
	do not know
	at what
	time the
	process started,
	there is
	no way
	in which we
	can be certain
	what any
	text represents-whether
	the full
	flush of
	the lan&shy;
	guage, the
	early onset
	of decrepitude,
	or the
	final phases
	of decay,
	in which key
	forms are
	lost or,
	worse, replaced
	by forms &amp;om
	competing languages and
	dialects. For 
	these reasons,
	we can
	dismiss the
	third of Muysken's
	six languages.
	


	This leaves
	PP,  SC,
	and  ST.
	Muysken  does
	not  state
	where  he acquired
	 the 
	data  from 
	Sao Tomense. 
	To the
	best  of
	my knowledge,
	there are
	only  two
	recent  descriptions
	 of
	the ST
	TMA system-Valkoff
	1966 
	and  Ferraz 
	1979-although 
	perhaps  one
	should say
	that there
	are three,  since 
	Valkoff   gives 
	two  different 
	ones  in 
	the  same 
	chapter. His account
	 is
	a somewhat 
	tortuous one,
	and the
	exact  status
	of these two
	descriptions is
	far from
	clear; he
	seems to
	suggest that
	the fll'st
	is in
	some  sense
	hypothetical,  though
	 whether 
	intended  as
	a reconstruc&shy;
	tion  of
	some  earlier 
	phase  of 
	ST,  or 
	of proto-Bight-of-Benin,
	 {\itshape is
	}far from
	dear. Be
	that as
	{\itshape it
	}may,
	one of
	the two
	forms he
	specifically stars
	as hypothetical 
	turns  up
	as real
	in Muysken's
	account, while
	four forms
	that appear
	in his
	second descriptio11
	do not 
	appear in
	the first.
	Ferraz mentions 
	Valkoff's
	work  but 
	does  not 
	discuss it;
	nor does
	he explain
	why,  or 
	even  note, 
	that  his 
	own  account 
	differs  substantively
	 from either 
	of Valkoff's.
	Finally, Muysken's
	account bears
	scam resemblance
	to any
	of the
	previous three.
	


	In Table
	2.1 on
	the following
	page, the
	various auxiliaries
	and combinations
	of auxiliaries
	claimed to
	occur in
	ST are
	arranged along the
	horizontal axis,
	and the
	four accounts
	(V<sub>1</sub><sub>

	In

	are not
	attested anywhere
	else, although
	to do
	him justice
	this  impression may
	 merely 
	result from a
	faulty formalism.
	Even making
	allowances for
	this, he
	attests four forms
	that the

	do not
	attest, and
	he fails
	to attest two
	that both

	names which
	the various
	tenses, modes,
	and aspects are
	given by
	these three
	authors. I
	shall give
	a single
	example. The names
	of the
	{\itshape ka
	+
	V
	}form
	are given,
	respectively, as:
	incompletive aorist,
	Valkoff <sub>1</sub><sub>
	</sub>;
	habitual,
	Valkoffi ;
	aorist,  Ferraz;
	incompletive, Muysken.
	This pattern
	is followed
	throughout. If
	a tense,
	mode, or aspect
	is mentioned
	in two
	accounts, it
	has two
	names; if
	in three,
	three names; if
	in four,
	four names.
	Sometimes the
	differences in
	name merely
	disguise the
	semantic similarities
	of the
	accounts; sometimes
	they mark
	real conflicts;
	sometimes  it is
	impossible  to 
	tell. In
	one case where
	there is
	a dear
	similarity between
	Valkoff's and
	Ferraz's accounts,
	Mnysken is
	dearly
	wrong. Â¥alkoff

	in the

	is
	obvious
	from their example

	whatever it
	is
	(and it
	looks like
	the anterior of
	the present
	analysis), it
	is
	not a
	simple past-which
	is what
	Muvsken says it
	is.
	Here, of

	evidence of
	Ferraz and
	Valko ff
	suports
	the position
	that Muysken
	is attacking.
	


	. .
	Muysken's
	analysis is
	supported by
	two example
	sentences. The
	ongmal form
	of the
	analysis he
	is attempting
	to undermine,
	in Bicker&shy;
	ton (1975:Chapter
	2), is
	supported by
	ninety-eight example
	sentences. Further
	comment  should 
	be  superfluous.
	Until someone
	is prepared to
	devote to
	the analysis
	of the
	ST system
	at least
	a fraction
	of the amount
	f
	areful
	work that
	went into
	the analysis
	of the
	GC system,
	we can
	d1sm1ss
	the fourth
	of Muysken's
	six counterexemplary
	systems.
	


	The wo
	remaining systems,
	those of
	PP and
	SC, have
	TMA sys\-tems
	too w1dely
	known to
	undergo much
	distortion, although
	even here
	Muysken's  account 
	is  unsatisfactory
	 in 
	several  respects.
	 However, sine
	the features
	of these
	and other
	systems which
	differ from
	my pred1ct1ons
	have been

	soon' and
	reducible to
	{\itshape lo.
	}And {\itshape lo,
	}as we
	have seen,
	is the
	Papiamentu form which
	deviates from
	the regular
	model.
	


	We will
	return to
	{\itshape lo
	}in a
	moment. First,
	let us
	look at
	the prove&shy;
	nance of
	{\itshape ba.
	}Most creoles
	have an
	&quot;earlier&quot;
	form  which
	 is
	derived from  a
	verb  with 
	the  meaning 
	'finish'; in 
	addition
	to {\itshape pau,
	}we find
	


	!OC
	{\itshape (fi)n
	}from Fr.
	{\itshape fini
	}'finished (p.
	part.)', English
	creole  {\itshape don
	
	}from another
	past participle,
	Eng. {\itshape done,
	}and Portuguese
	 creole
	{\itshape (
	ka)ba 
	}from Pg.
	{\itshape acabar
	}'finish' {\itshape (
	kaba
	}is found
	in SR
	also). Looking
	over the
	range of
	creoles, it
	would seem
	that such
	markers can
	have three
	distinct distributions.
	


	First, they
	may remain
	as marginal
	particles, occurring
	option\-ally
	in clause-final
	position. This
	state is
	exemplified by
	SR, in
	which {\itshape kaba
	}can only
	occur clause-fmally
	and is
	never incorporated
	into Aux. The same
	is true
	of PP
	{\itshape caba.
	}In
	basilectal GC,
	{\itshape don
	}often occurs
	clause\-finally (cf.
	Bickerton 1975:Examples
	2.65-67).
	


	Second, they
	may be
	incorporated into
	Aux but
	without  its being
	possible to
	combine them
	with other 
	Aux  constituents.
	 This state
	is exemplified
	by mesolectal
	GC {\itshape don
	}and possibly
	also JC
	and
	


	other
	Caribbean
	{\itshape don
	}and
	by
	HC
	{\itshape fin.}
	


	Third, they
	may be
	incorporated into
	Aux where
	they may combine
	with other
	Aux constituents
	quite freely.
	This state
	is exem&shy;
	plified
	by.Krio (KR)
	{\itshape don,
	}and IOC
	{\itshape (fi
	)n,
	}among others.
	


	If we
	were working
	with a
	static-synchronic model,
	we would have
	to stop
	with this
	statement. However,
	since we
	have to
	work with a
	dynamic model
	in order
	to account
	for creole
	development, we
	can next propose
	that these
	three &quot;states&quot;
	in fact
	constitute stages
	in a diachronic
	development and
	exemplify a
	gradual process
	of incorpora&shy;
	tion which
	is well
	advanced in  some
	creoles and
	has not
	begun in others.
	In order
	to prove
	that states
	in
	different
	languages show
	differ\-ent stages
	of the
	same process,
	it is
	desirable to
	be able
	to point
	to languages in
	which two
	stages co-exist
	synchronically.
	Basilectal GC
	has both postclausal
	and preverbal
	{\itshape don,
	}the latter
	becoming obligatory
	in the mesolectal
	varieties; thus
	GC represents
	the transition
	between states one
	 and 
	two. Evidence 
	for I0C
	is conflicting,
	but  by 
	at least
	


	CREOLE<sub>	81</sub>
	


	some accounts,
	stages intermediate
	between noncombinability
	and free
	combinability (states
	two and
	three) are
	to be
	found there.

	derives from

	}has followed
	a similar

	I have
	consistently 'claimed
	that  differences 
	between  TP
	and classic
	creoles would 
	result  from
	differenc s
	in their
	histories, in
	particular the
	period of
	several genera&shy;
	tions which
	TP passed
	as a
	pidgin prior
	to creolization.
	Such a
	period would allow
	time for
	the original
	sequence-markers to
	become firm!y
	established in
	the
	language and
	to take
	on more
	tense-like and
	modal\-like meanings
	through the
	operations of
	natural change.
	By the
	time TP creolfaed,
	therefore, it
	had already
	developed a
	complex auxiliary
	system, without
	any of
	the catastrophic
	suddenness which,
	as we
	saw


	


	82	<sup>ROOTS</sup><sup> </sup><sup>OF</sup><sup>
	</sup><sup>LANGUAGE</sup>
	


	

	
	


	in Chapter
	1,
	characterizes true
	creoles. The
	first creole
	generation in TP
	was therefore
	presented with
	a fait
	accompli; all
	it could
	do was accept
	the markers
	bequeathed to
	it and
	carry out
	some minor
	cosmetic operations on
	{\itshape baimbai,
	}phonologically
	reducing it
	and shifting
	it to
	a more  &quot;appropriate&quot;
	position.
	


	The gap
	between TP
	and true
	creoles is
	not, of
	course, an
	abso\-lute one.
	Some of
	the features
	that distinguish
	TP (prolonged
	growth period, sustained
	bilingualism, etc.)
	could be
	shared to
	a
	lesser extent
	with some
	0Â£
	the true
	creoles. In
	the case
	of Crioulo,
	evidence is
	flatly contradictory:
	&quot;Crioulo .
	. .has
	no native
	speakers&quot; (Alleyne
	1979); &quot;Crioulo
	. . .
	[is]  the 
	ft'tst
	language  of
	many who
	are born 
	and bred
	


	in  the 
	main  towns&quot; 
	(Wilson  1962:vii).
	A plausible 
	compromise  would
	seem  to 
	be  late 
	creolization   followed
	 by 
	the  persistence 
	of  a 
	small native-speaker 
	core within 
	a wide 
	lingua-franca penumbra.
	 Under 
	such circumstances,   a
	
	more  gradual
	 transition
	 from 
	pidgin  to 
	creole,  with
	concomitant  retention
	of more
	pidgin  features,
	is certainly 
	a
	possibility.
	Curaqao,  home 
	of  Papiamentu,  
	might  at
	 
	fast  sight
	 look 
	very different   from
	  the 
	Guinea  of 
	Ctioulo-a  Caribbean
	 island 
	where  sus&quot;
	tained   bilingualism
	  would  
	have  been 
	impossible.  However,
	 Curaao
	differs  from 
	most  Caribbean 
	islands 
	in  that 
	it 
	is  extremely
	 dry 
	and infertile. 
	For over 
	a century,
	before  the 
	Dutch  seized 
	it, and
	indeed to some 
	extent  thereafter,
	 it 
	served  as  a
	staging  post 
	in  the
	slave trade, a
	
	place  where
	  slaves 
	were  held 
	and  seasoned 
	while  awaiting 
	trans\-portation  to
	 other 
	points  in
	the 
	Caribbean  or 
	Latin  America. 
	With  a constant  
	turnover   in  
	the   population, 
	 and 
	transients  always
	 heavily outnumbering 
	the  minority 
	who remained, 
	it may
	well be
	that a
	pidgin stage persisted
	 here
	much longer
	than it
	did elsewhere
	in the
	Caribbean, or at
	least long
	enough for
	more pidgin 
	features to
	establish themselves.
	Clearly,  in
	both  cases,
	more historical
	study is
	needed, but
	the hypothe&shy;
	sis  of 
	somewhat   delayed
	  creolization  would 
	both  explain 
	the  phe&shy;
	nomena   involved 
	and  accord 
	with  our 
	present   knowledge
	 of 
	social
	


	history.

	Let us
	turn now
	to Deviation
	C (
	p. 77),
	the past
	versus anterior
	issue. In
	the first
	place, it
	must be
	made clear
	that GC,
	SR, and
	HC were generally
	claitned to
	have past-tense
	markers, prior
	to my
	re\-analysis of
	their TMA
	systems (see,
	e.g., Hall
	[1953] for
	HC, Voorhoeve
	[1957]
	for SR,
	etc.). However,
	that reanalysis
	has not
	been seriously
	challenged. !l
	It seems
	reasonable, therefore,
	to suppose
	that in
	a
	number of
	other creoles
	which Idid
	not specifically
	examine, markers
	are still
	being described
	as &quot;past&quot;
	which in
	reality are
	+anterior.
	


	Let  us 
	examine  a
	language,
	Seychelles Creole,
	of which 
	this claim
	is frequently
	made. According
	to Corne
	(1977: 102),
	&quot;the marker
	{\itshape ti
	}defines
	the past, 
	both  simple 
	and  habit
	ual&quot;; according
	to Bollee (1977
	:55), {\itshape &quot;ti
	}expresses
	the past, definite
	or indefinite; it
	is comparable
	to the
	past tense
	in English.&quot;
	However, these
	confident and
	sweeping statements
	are immediately
	modified by
	both parties.
	Corne observes
	that  &quot;once
	past time
	has been
	established in
	a given
	situation, {\itshape ti
	}is frequently 
	omitted,&quot; 
	especially  in
	narratives 
	&quot;where,
	after an
	initial use
	(or uses)
	of {\itshape ti,
	}much of
	the remainder
	of the story may
	be told
	with verb forms
	unmarked  for
	Past  (i.e.,
	as a
	sort of
	'historical present').&quot;
	This &quot;historical
	 present&quot; 
	also crops 
	up in
	Bailee's second
	thoughts. While,
	according to
	her, the
	zero or
	stem form
	of the
	verb &quot;has
	the value  of 
	the  French 
	present  tense&quot;-the
	 reader 
	will  note 
	the Euro&quot;
	centrism  that 
	unites  these 
	accounts-it
	also expresses
	the  &quot;historical
	present&quot;  which 
	is
	&quot;above
	all others
	the narrative 
	tense .
	. .
	. After
	a
	brief introduction
	in the
	past, the
	rest of
	the story
	is told
	in the
	pres\-ent.&quot;
	However,  she
	immediately  adds
	a second
	second thought:
	&quot;The above
	is not
	quite correct;
	the past
	often reappears
	at the opening
	of a
	


	new  paragraph.&quot;
	


	Accounts of
	this nature
	inevitably  arouse one's
	 suspicions,
	especially as
	the First
	Law of
	Creole Studies
	states: &quot;Every
	creolist's
	analysis can
	be directly
	contradicted by
	that creolist's
	own texts
	and citations.'' To
	demonstrate this
	law, I
	will analyze
	the middle
	portion
	


	of
	
	the
	
	second
	
	paragraph
	
	of
	the
	story
	{\itshape Sabotaz

	Here, as
	in many
	other places
	in Bailee's
	texts, the
	narrative switches from
	&quot;historical 
	present&quot;  into
	 &quot;past
	&quot; and
	back  again,
	right in mid-paragraph.
	Even Bollee's
	final disclaimer,
	therefore, will
	not work here.
	What is
	the explanation?
	


	The alert
	reader will
	perhaps have
	noticed that
	the &quot;historical
	present&quot; verbs
	that immediately
	precede and
	follow the
	switch into &quot;past&quot;
	are both
	nonstatives- resevwar
	'receive',
	{\itshape gaj{e)
	}'obtain,
	take'\-while the
	three verbs
	marked with
	{\itshape ti
	}are all
	statives-ana
	'have', {\itshape ule}
	


	'want'<sub>,</sub><sub>
	</sub>and 
	{\itshape kone 
	}'know'.
	If we 
	refer  back  to
	the sto<sub>.</sub>ry
	openings that
	


	both Corne
	and Bollee
	mention, we
	find that
	the verbs
	marked there
	by
	


	{\itshape ti
	}ate also
	starives. Folktales
	almost invariably
	begin with
	one or
	several of these:
	&quot;Once
	upon a
	time there
	{\itshape was }a
	girl â¢
	. .
	she {\itshape was
	called
	}such and
	such .
	. .
	she {\itshape had
	}two sisters
	. .
	.&quot;
	It is 
	this  simple 
	coincidence  that
	has given
	rise to
	the hard-dying
	creole myth
	about &quot;narrative
	tenses&quot; and
	&quot;historical
	presents.&quot;
	


	In fact,
	in systems
	which
	have the
	feature anterior,
	past-reference
	nonstatives ate
	unmarked, while
	past-reference statives
	receive anterior
	


	\
	


	CREOLE<sub>	85</sub>
	


	marking (see
	Bickerton [1975:Chapter
	{\itshape 2
	]
	}for an
	explanation of
	why this
	is so).
	Thus, the 
	distribution of
	{\itshape ti
	}and zero
	in SC
	texts follows
	exactly the
	same rule
	of anterior
	marking that
	affects stative
	and nonstative pasts
	in GC,
	HC, SR,
	etc.
	


	Bollee and
	Corne cannot
	be blamed
	too heavily
	for this
	faulty analysis since
	SC is
	not a
	pure anterior
	system but
	one which
	under\-went certain
	changes when
	the completive
	{\itshape (fi)n
	}was
	incorporated into
	Aux and
	permitted to
	combine with
	other markers.
	We shall
	see the
	


	consequences of
	this when
	we return
	to SC
	in the
	discussion
	of DeviaÂ·
	tion D.
	


	However, there
	are creoles
	in which
	the presence
	of the
	category past cannot
	be attributed 
	to  faulty
	analyses. Papiamentu
	 is
	perhaps the best
	attested of
	these so,
	pending adequate
	data on
	the few
	creoles that
	seem to
	resemble it,
	we may
	take the
	PP model
	as typical.
	I pro\-pose
	to claim
	that wherever
	this deviance
	is
	attested, it
	is the
	result of either
	heavy superstrate
	influence on
	the pidgin
	stage, or
	(more prob&shy;
	able in
	the majority
	of cases)
	subsequent
	decreolization.
	


	In the
	first place,
	in
	both HCE
	and GC,
	where decreolization
	phenomena are
	clear and
	well understood,
	the shift
	from anterior
	mark\-ing to
	past marking
	represents one
	of the
	earliest
	superstrate-influenced
	changes (Bickerton
	1975, 1977).
	Even in
	Sranan, no
	longer in
	contact ' ith
	its superstrate,
	a imilar
	change is
	taking
	place at
	least among
	literate Sranan-Dutch
	bilmguals as
	can be
	seen if
	we compare
	the
	


	most  recent 
	texts with 
	earlier  ones 
	in,  e.g.,
	Voorhoeve  and
	Lichtveld (1976).
	


	However, a
	problem arises
	in the
	case of
	languages for
	which, unlike GC
	or SR,
	no prior anterior
	stage is
	attested. Can
	we reconstruct
	such a
	stage from
	synchronic
	evidence?
	


	There is
	a good
	likelihood that
	we can.
	In Bickerton
	(1980)
	I showed
	that we
	could differentiate
	between decreolization
	stages and natural
	changes: the
	former changed
	forms first
	and functions
	later; while
	the latter
	preserved old 
	forms and
	gave them
	new functions. If
	the changes
	in
	PP are
	due
	to decreolization,
	and if
	there was
	an original 
	anterior  marker, 
	then  it 
	follows that
	whatever  is
	the past

	marker now
	could not
	have been
	the anterior
	marker then;
	in decreoli&shy;
	zation,  instead 
	of  the 
	original  marker 
	changing  its 
	function,  a
	new marker  is 
	first  adopted 
	alongside  of 
	it,  otiginally 
	with  an 
	identical
	meaning  (did
	 alongside
	 GC
	{\itshape bin,
	wen 
	}alongside  HCE
	 {\itshape bin),
	
	}and  then
	gradually  changes
	 its 
	meaning  to 
	+past  while 
	the  original 
	anterior marker
	disappears or,
	if
	we are
	lucky, remains
	fossilized in
	some social or
	grammatical corner
	of the
	language. So,
	if we
	are both
	correct and
	Â· lucky, we
	should be
	able to
	find in
	PP both
	a synchronic
	past marker
	


	and some
	vestige of
	the otiginal
	anterior marker
	it displaced.
	


	The PP
	past  marker 
	is {\itshape a,
	}presumably 
	cognate with
	PQ {\itshape a,
	}PK {\itshape ya
	}all  of 
	which  most 
	probably  derive 
	from  Pg.
	{\itshape ja
	
	}'already'. 
	Adverbs,  as we
	have  seen,
	are not 
	a good 
	source for
	creole TMA
	markers. Anterior
	markers  are 
	most  often 
	recruited   from 
	a  past 
	copula  form: 
	Fr.  {\itshape ete}
	


	yielding
	French creole
	{\itshape ti,
	te,
	}etc.; Eng.
	{\itshape been
	}yielding
	 English 
	creole {\itshape bin,
	ben,
	}etc.; and
	Pg. {\itshape estava
	}yielding ST
	(and other
	Bight-of-Benin creole)
	{\itshape tava.
	Tava/
	taba
	}is therefore
	what one
	would predict
	as an anterior
	marker in
	the original stage
	of any
	Portuguese creole.
	


	{\itshape Taha
	}is of
	course well
	attested for
	PP, and
	its distribution
	is most
	


	interesting.  Unlike 
	other  auxiliaries,
	 it 
	cannot  occur 
	alone  before 
	a verb,
	but only
	in conjunction
	with nonpunctual
	{\itshape ta:}

	We may  therefore
	propose the
	following scenario
	for Papia&shy;
	mentu, Originally,
	it had
	{\itshape taba
	}anterior  and
	{\itshape ta
	}nonpunctualÂ·,
	permitting the formation
	of {\itshape tabata
	}(it is
	hard to
	think of
	any other
	way in
	which this form
	could have
	been derived).
	Decreolizatio11 then
	began, via contact
	between PP
	and the
	Spanish of
	the Venezuelan
	mainland only a 
	ew  miles 
	away.  Spanish 
	{\itshape ya
	
	}could 
	have  been 
	the  model 
	as easily as
	.Pg. {\itshape ja;
	}indeed,
	for PP-Spanish 
	bilinguals,  {\itshape ya
	
	}and {\itshape ha,
	}the
	Spanish 3rd pets.
	perfective  marker,
	 could 
	have  easily
	reinforced  one
	another {\itshape to
	}merge in
	{\itshape a.
	}The
	result of
	borrowing {\itshape a
	}as a
	past marker
	would have been
	to bring
	Papiamentu,
	phonologically as
	well  as
	semantically, n1ore in
	line with
	its prestigious
	neighbor. But
	by the
	time {\itshape a
	}entered the
	language, {\itshape tabata
	}would already
	have come
	to be
	perceived  as
	a single unit
	(as its
	modern orthography
	suggests) and
	would thus
	have survived the
	subsequent disappearance
	 of 
	{\itshape taba. 
	}Similarly,  {\itshape ti
	pe,
	
	}an SC
	form of
	comparable meaning,
	was retained
	even when
	some anterior
	fortctions ofti
	were taken
	over by
	{\itshape (fi
	]n.}
	


	A
	further
	argument for
	an original
	anterior-nonanterior
	distinc\-tion inÂ·
	Papiall1e11tu
	comes from
	the synchronic
	distribution of
	zero forms.
	Fol&quot;  example, Goilo
	(1953:107)
	observes that
	stem forms express
	the present
	indicative for
	verbs such
	as {\itshape gusta
	}'like',
	{\itshape quier
	}'love', {\itshape jama
	}'be
	called', etc.-i.e.,
	statives--while all
	other verbs
	form the
	same tense
	with {\itshape ta.
	}It should
	be made
	quite clear
	that this
	is not aparallel
	to the
	English 
	habitual-progressive 
	distinction. In
	English,
	


	we
	can
	have
	{\itshape I
	write
	}as
	well
	as
	{\itshape I
	want,
	}and
	there
	exists
	the
	opposition
	


	{\itshape I
	write/l
	am
	writing.
	}Papiamentu
	presents
	quite
	a
	different
	picture:
	


	

	
	


	/99/	mi quier
	esaquinan 'I
	want these'
	


	/160/
	*mita
	quier esaquinan
	


	/101/
	*miskirbi
	buki
	


	/102/
	mi ta
	skirbi buki
	


	'lwrite
	books/am writing
	a book'
	


	

	
	


	If Papiamentu
	started life
	with  a
	simple past-present
	 opposition,

	expressed by
	{\itshape a
	}versus {\itshape ta,
	}then the
	fact that
	statives in
	the present cannot
	take {\itshape ta,
	}while
	nonstatives must,
	becomes merely
	a mysterious
	anomaly. However,
	if it
	began with
	an anterior-nonanterior
	opposition, the fact
	is well
	motivated. In all
	such systems,
	present-reference
	statives are unmarked
	(since by
	definition they
	cannot take
	nonpunctual mark&shy;
	ing), and
	present-reference
	nonstatives are
	obligatorily marked
	with the
	nonpunctual morpheme
	(since any
	event or
	action that
	is ongoing
	in the present
	must  be either
	durative or
	part of
	a series,
	whereas, con&shy;
	versely, any
	punctual event
	or action
	must be over,
	i.e., in
	the past, by
	the time
	it can
	be referred
	to!).  The distribution
	of zeros
	and nonpunctuals in PP
	is identical
	to that
	of synchronic
	SR or
	basilectal GC, except
	for one
	thing: in
	the latter,
	past punctuals,
	as well
	as present statives,
	are zero-marked
	(again, Bickerton
	(1975:Chapter
	2] explains
	why this
	should be
	{\itshape so).
	}In Papiamentu,
	{\itshape a
	}has moved
	in
	to fill
	the &quot;vacuum&quot;
	created by
	zero-marked
	past-reference
	nonstatives, thereby
	bringing the
	PP TMA
	system closer
	to European
	models, but,
	again, as
	with {\itshape tabata,
	}leaving clear
	traces of
	the more
	creole system that
	must have
	existed at
	an earlier
	stage.<sup>12</sup>
	


	

	
	


	We can
	now turn
	to Deviation
	D: the
	fact that
	MC  and 
	SC contain both
	{\itshape ti
	}and {\itshape (fi
	)n,
	a
	}and {\itshape pu.}
	


	First, I
	shall have
	to comment
	on the
	state-of-the-art in
	Indian Ocean creoles.
	In MC
	and SC,
	and a
	fortiori in
	Reunion Creole,
	that state is
	perhaps best
	exemplified by
	the following
	pessimistic
	remarks of
	Corne (1977:94-95):
	


	

	
	


	A close
	study of
	SC preverbal
	markers has
	been made
	by Bollee, by
	Papen and
	by myself,
	and the
	results of
	our efforts do 
	not always
	coincide . .
	. .
	The sociolinguistic
	background of
	our informants
	is to 
	some extent 
	different, and this
	alone is
	&lt;1uite
	possibly the
	source  of 
	conflicting data.
	It seems
	likely that
	some speakers
	categorise given
	markers differently 
	from other 
	speakers.

	Methods which
	make it
	possible, without
	invoking extralinguistic
	data, to
	systematically order
	and account
	for all
	variations in
	such systems were
	publicly presented
	by DeCamp
	in 1968
	(DeCamp 1971),
	refined and
	extended by
	C.-J. Bailey
	(1973, etc.),
	and applied
	to the analysis
	of a
	seemingly far
	worse preverbal
	chaos in
	Bickerton (1975),
	afte; they
	had been
	proven effective
	in a
	number of other
	areas where
	creoles showed
	similar variation
	(Bickerton 1971,
	1973a, 
	1973b,
	etc.). The bibliographies
	of Baker,
	Bailee, Corne,
	and other
	IOC scholars
	(Carayol and 
	Chaudenson  [1977]
	 is
	a distinguished 
	exception)
	betray no awareness
	of any
	of this
	work, which
	I suppose
	merely reflects
	the parochialism that
	 afflicts 
	the  field. 
	Given  this 
	methodological  time
	lag, anything
	one says
	about !OC
	TMA systems
	must be
	treated as
	provisional.
	


	Combinations of
	markers form
	the liveliest
	areas of
	dispute. According to
	Baker (1972)
	and Valdman
	(1980),
	{\itshape (ji
	)n
	}will combine
	only with
	{\itshape ti
	}in MC;
	according to Moorghen
	(1975),
	it will
	also combine
	with {\itshape a
	}and {\itshape pu.
	}According to
	Bailee (1977),
	{\itshape (fi
	)n
	}will combine
	with {\itshape a
	}and {\itshape pu
	}in SC,
	but not
	with {\itshape pe;
	}according to
	Corne (1977),
	{\itshape n
	pe
	}com\-binations
	are found,
	in addition
	to the
	others.
	


	A dynamic
	analysis can
	easily reconcile
	all
	these apparent
	contra&shy;
	


	dictions. It
	was suggested 
	earlier that 
	between  the
	second stage
	of {\itshape (fi
	jn
	}incorporation-movement
	into Aux-and
	the third
	stage of
	{\itshape (fi)n
	}incorporation-
	free combinability
	with other
	preverbal markers-we
	would expect
	to fmd
	intermediate stages,
	and the
	data in
	the previous
	paragraph suggest
	just such stages,
	preserved synchronically
	in the Indian
	Ocean population
	either by
	different groups,
	or at
	different stylistic
	levels, or
	both. If
	those  data 
	are  correct,
	it would 
	appear that the
	combinability of
	{\itshape (fi)n
	}began with
	{\itshape ti
	}in SC,
	spread to
	MC, while
	in SC it
	extended
	also to
	{\itshape pu
	}and {\itshape a,
	}and
	(for at
	least some speak&shy;
	ers) spread
	to {\itshape pu
	
	}and {\itshape a
	}in MC
	while it
	was extending
	to {\itshape pe
	
	}in SC&shy;
	a classic
	demonstration of
	Bailevan wave
	theory.13 This
	proposal is made
	all
	the more
	plausible by
	he fact
	that combinability
	proceeds from tense,
	the leftmost
	Aux constituent,
	to modal,
	the second
	left\-most, to
	aspect, the
	rightmost (which,
	perhaps coincidentally,
	perhaps

	not,  is
	a 
	conjunction  of
	 two 
	members  of 
	the  same 
	class, {\itshape (ji
	}n 
	}being a
	
	completive, 
	therefore  aspectual,
	 and 
	therefore,  initially
	 perhaps, being
	in the
	same  slot  as
	{\itshape pe
	
	}and 
	thus barred 
	from co-occurring 
	with it).
	


	

	
	


	We are
	now almost
	ready to
	consider what
	would have
	been the
	repercussions of
	an invasion
	by {\itshape (fi)n
	}of a
	classic creole
	system. First,
	however, we
	must note
	a particular
	characteristic of
	TMA systems which,
	thongh seemingly
	obvious, has
	been ignored
	by virtually
	all work up
	to and
	including Comrie's
	(1976)
	influential study
	of aspect.
	Meillet's famous
	observation that
	&quot;language
	is a
	system in
	which every&shy;
	thing keeps
	its place&quot;
	has the
	corollary that
	if a
	new element
	intrudes, everything must
	shift its
	place somewhat;
	while the
	latter statement
	may not
	be true
	of languages
	considered as
	wholes, it
	is
	certainly
	true for tight
	little grammatical
	subsystems like
	those of
	TMA. A
	TMA system may
	be compared
	to a
	cake, a cake
	that is
	always the
	same size, for
	TMA systems,
	whether simple
	or complex,
	all have
	to cover
	the same semantic
	area: every
	verb has
	to have
	some tense,
	mood, aspect, or
	combination of
	these applied
	to it,
	for there
	are (pace
	some creolists) no
	such things
	as &quot;TMA-neutral&quot;
	sentences.
	


	But a
	cake may
	be split
	up into
	five, or
	eight, or
	ten slices,
	just as a
	TMA system
	can divide
	its semantic
	area among
	five, or
	eight, or ten TMA
	markers and/or
	combinations of
	markers. If
	a cake
	is divided into
	five slices,
	while another
	identical to
	it is
	divided into eight
	slices, there
	is no
	way in
	which each
	of the
	slices
	in Cake
	A can contain
	exactly the
	same amount
	of material
	as each
	of the
	slices
	in Cake B. 
	In  other
	words, how
	much, and
	exactly what,
	is contained in
	each slice
	will be
	largely determined
	by the
	number of
	slices. This is
	exactly the
	state of
	affairs in
	TMA systems
	throughout language;
	what each
	marker of
	modality, tense,
	or aspect
	means will
	be largely
	determined by
	how many
	markers of
	these things
	there are
	in the system
	and by
	what each
	of the
	others mean.
	Facts such
	as these
	are, however, ignored
	by most
	scholars in
	the field,
	who strive
	to fit
	all phenomena  into
	 the 
	same  conceptual 
	straitjacket,  and
	 who, 
	when

	this fails,
	as fail
	it must,
	then seek,
	like
	Comrie, some
	kind of
	ideal type of
	the &quot;Progressive&quot;
	or the
	&quot;Perfective.&quot;
	


	The
	main point 
	to be
	grasped here
	is that
	if you
	mark out
	a cake
	


	to be
	cut into
	{\itshape n
	}slices,
	then change
	your mind
	and decide
	to cut
	{\itshape n
	}+
	1,
	you can
	only get
	your extra
	slice at
	the expense
	of one
	or more
	of the otiginals.
	Thus, if
	{\itshape (ji
	)n
	}were
	introduced as
	a ninth
	term into
	the classic
	eight-term creole
	system, it
	could only be
	accommodated by
	robbing the semantic
	domain of
	one or
	more existing
	markers.
	


	Since
	{\itshape {fi
	)n
	
	}conjoined
	
	first
	with
	{\itshape ti,
	}it
	is
	not
	surprising
	that
	{\itshape ti
	}was
	


	its main
	victim. Admittedly,
	{\itshape ti
	}held
	its ground
	with statives,
	as we
	saw in
	/94/,<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup><sup>
	</sup>and in
	the nonpunctual
	{\itshape ti
	pe
	}structure;
	the picture
	with punctual nonstatives
	is more
	complex. To
	clarify it,
	we need
	to refme the
	concept of
	anterior, which
	we can
	provisionally define
	as &quot;prior
	to the current
	focus of
	discourse.&quot; But
	current focus
	may be
	explicit (where the
	times of
	an earlier
	and later
	event are
	directly contrasted),
	


	or implicit
	(where the
	relationship
	between the
	earlier and
	later events
	is simply
	assumed), or
	there may
	be nothing
	prior to
	current focus.
	


	.The situation
	will become
	clearer with
	the following
	examples:
	


	

	
	


	/103/
	Current focus,
	nothing prior:
	


	Eng.:	Bill has
	come/came to
	see you GC:	Bi!
	(don) kom
	fi sii
	yu
	


	/104/
	Prior event,
	current focus
	implicit:
	


	Eng.:
	Bill came/*has/*had

	see you
	yesterday, too
	GC:	Bil bin
	kom/*don kom/*kom
	fi

	/105/
	Prior event,

	explicit:
	


	Eng.:	When   I 
	got  here, 
	Bill  had 
	come/*has 
	come/*came already
	


	GC:	wen mi
	riich, bi!

	In /104/
	current focus
	is on
	the present,
	second visit
	of Bill
	implied by
	{\itshape too;
	}this,
	English can
	handle by
	one of
	the means
	available for /103/,
	but the
	anterior system
	of GC
	cannot. Example
	/104/
	has to
	be treated
	exactly like
	/105/ in

	in  English. 
	This  illustrates
	just  one 
	of  the 
	many differences
	between past-nonpast
	and anterior-nonanterior
	systems.
	


	Corne (1977:107)
	has an
	illuminating minimal
	pair which
	shows that
	SC behaves
	much more
	like GC
	than like
	English. on
	&quot;current
	focus, nothing  prior&quot;
	cases like
	/106/
	and &quot;prior

	focus implicit&quot;
	cases like
	/108/;
	GC translations
	follow each
	example:

	}isi
	pur eksplik

	{\itshape bin

	}ya

	.
	


	

	
	


	The implicit
	current focus is
	of course
	the speaker's
	most recent
	arrival, since he
	could not
	say {\itshape I
	came
	}unless
	he were
	here again.
	


	However, when
	current focus
	is explicit,
	SC and
	GC part
	com\-pany (SC
	example from
	Corne [1977:108]
	) :

	In other
	words, it
	is only
	where there
	is prior
	reference with
	explicit current
	focus-i.e., when
	two past
	events have
	to be
	explicitly ordered
	with respect
	to one
	another-that {\itshape ti
	n
	}encroaches
	on the
	domain of
	anterior {\itshape ti,
	}However, reference
	of this
	kind is
	probably the
	most perÂ·
	ceptually obvious
	of anterior
	functions (certainly
	it is
	the easiest
	to teach
	in creole

	its loss
	to a

	to erode

	direction of
	a past-

	once one
	begins to
	get {\itshape (

	}constructions.
	In the
	classic system,
	irrealis handles
	condi&shy;
	tionals a1.1d
	there is
	no distinction
	between probable
	and improbable
	conditions,
	so long
	as they
	are not
	counterfactual
	conditions:
	


	

	
	


	/112/

	mi

	'I'll tell
	him if I
	see him'
	or 'l
	would tell
	him if
	l saw
	him'
	


	

	
	


	Counterfactuals are
	expressed by
	a combination
	of anterior
	and irrealis:
	anterior because
	current focus
	in
	such cases
	is always
	on the
	conse\-quences of
	not having
	done whatever
	one didn't
	do; and
	irrealis because
	the action
	or event
	in question
	is an
	imaginary one:

	'If I
	had seen

	.
	 
	In
	SC,
	{\itshape ti
	a
	n
	}(and
	less
	commonly,
	{\itshape ti
	pit
	n)
	}naturally
	takes
	over
	from
	a
	prior
	{\itshape ti
	a,
	}the
	&quot;pastest&quot;
	among
	conditions:
	counterfactuals
	such
	


	as /113/,
	yielding sentences
	such as
	/114/
	(example from
	Corne 1977:
	


	109):
	


	

	
	


	/H4/
	mo

	GC: mi
	{\itshape bin

	}mari
	if
	mi na
	bin puur
	


	

	
	


	The result
	of this
	development is
	another change
	in
	the system.
	The coming into
	existence of
	{\itshape ti
	a
	n
	}does
	not automatically
	remove the former
	expression
	of counterfactuals,
	{\itshape ti
	a;
	ti
	a
	}remains
	in the lan&shy;
	guage, and
	what remains
	in the
	language has
	to mean
	something. The
	consequence of
	the {\itshape ti
	a
	n
	}invasion
	is therefore
	the shifting
	of {\itshape ti
	a
	}one step
	down the
	hierarchy of
	conditions, from
	impossible to
	merely
	


	improbable
	{\itshape (if
	X
	,
	I
	would
	}Y)-again,
	the
	example
	is
	from
	Corne
	(1977:
	106):

	A further
	erosion of
	anterior terrain
	is indicated
	by the
	structure of the
	subordinate clauses
	in these
	examples. Note
	that the
	subordinate clause in
	counterfactual 1115/
	requires anterior
	marking but
	that the
	subordinate clause
	in the
	merely improbable
	{\itshape {117}/
	does not
	; this
	is classic
	anterior marking.
	However, the
	subordinate clauses
	in both
	counterfactual /114/
	and merely
	improbable /116/
	are marked
	with {\itshape ti,
	}presumably
	because  subordinate
	clause marking
	is
	dragged down,
	so to speak,
	by the
	shift of
	{\itshape ti
	a
	}main-clause marking
	from counterfactuals
	


	to improbables.
	


	In other
	words, once
	you turn
	a completive
	loose in
	a classic creole
	TMA system,
	the only
	consequence must
	be a
	drastic remodeling
	of that
	system. Some
	creoles (SR,
	basilecta!GC,
	HC) have
	kept their
	completives under
	control either
	by keeping
	them out
	of Aux
	al\-together or
	by allowing
	them in
	but not
	letting them
	combine with other
	auxiliaries. It is
	not coincidence
	that these
	creoles are
	ones which have
	kept the
	classic
	TMA system
	virtually intact.
	On the
	other hand, creoles
	that have
	let the
	completive
	have the
	run of
	the house&shy;
	such as
	SC, MC,
	and Krio-have,
	in consequence,
	had to
	change their
	TMA systems
	to a
	point at
	which reconstruction
	of the
	original system
	becomes quite
	difficult,
	although not-thanks
	to the
	careful work
	of Corne and
	others-impossible.
	


	The curious
	reader may
	well ask,
	&quot;Why
	is it
	that some
	systems
	


	have let
	loose their
	completives, while
	others have
	not?&quot; Ihave
	no answer
	to that,
	at
	present. Suffice
	it to
	say that
	doing so
	must remain an
	option within
	any theory
	of linguistic
	change; if
	the option
	is taken, certain
	results must
	follow, as
	night, day;
	if it
	is not,
	they  will
	not. It would
	be interesting
	to know
	why, but
	the fact
	that we
	do not
	can in no
	way affect
	the validity
	of the
	foregoing analysis.

	The other
	main divergence
	of IOC
	from the
	classic model
	is
	the presence of
	two &quot;future&quot;
	forms, {\itshape a
	}and
	{\itshape pu.
	}Several
	things are
	at issue here.
	One of
	them is
	why either
	form should
	be limited to
	future, rather than
	being a
	true  irrealis. In
	{\itshape fact
	,
	}on the
	evidence of
	Corne (1977:103),
	{\itshape pu
	}retains
	conditional meaning,
	if only
	in subordinate
	clauses, and thus
	still covers
	a large
	part of
	the semantic
	area of
	ir\-realis:
	


	

	
	


	{\itshape {118{
	}ipa
	ti
	kone
	ki
	i
	{\itshape pu
	}fer
	


	he not TNS
	know what
	he MOD
	do 'He
	didn't know
	what he
	would do'
	


	/119/
	GC: i
	na (bin)
	no wa
	igo du/wa
	fe du
	



	
	


	The GC
	translation is
	instructive in
	several respects.
	First, the
	optionality of
	{\itshape bin
	}serves
	to underscore
	another characteristic
	of ante\-rior
	as opposed
	to past
	marking. Expressions
	like {\itshape he
	didn't
	know
	}are ambiguous
	between  'he didn't
	know, but
	he knows
	now' and
	'he didn't know
	then and
	he still
	doesn't know'.
	In the
	first reading,
	{\itshape bin
	}is
	obli&shy;
	gatorily present
	since this
	reading represents
	another instance
	of prior event
	(or rather,
	prior state, in
	this case)
	with implicit
	current focus,
	i.e., upon
	the change
	in state
	of the
	person referred
	to. In
	the second
	reading, {\itshape bin
	}is
	obligatorily
	absent since
	the state
	of not
	knowing is
	a continuing one,
	and there
	is therefore
	nothing prior
	to refer
	to.
	


	Second,
	we
	see
	again
	 that
	the
	range
	of
	a
	true
	irrealis
	(Ge
	{\itshape go)
	}parallels
	at
	least
	part
	of
	the
	range
	 of
	an
	SC
	marker.
	But
	the
	third
	point
	is
	perhaps
	the
	most
	interesting.
	{\itshape He
	
	did
	not
	know
	what
	he
	would
	do
	}is
	semantically
	close
	to,
	if
	not
	quite
	synonymous
	with,
	{\itshape he
	did
	not
	know}
	


	{\itshape what

	{\itshape F'i
	}(which often
	takes the
	form {\itshape Ju
	)
	}derives
	from Eng.
	{\itshape for,
	}while {\itshape pu
	}derives from
	Fr. {\itshape pour
	}'for'. {\itshape Fi
	}can
	also be
	a complementizer,
	as can {\itshape pu.
	Fi
	}can
	occur as
	an auxiliary
	in its
	own right:

	'I should{ought

	<sub>96	</sub>ROOTS

	Note that
	{\itshape Ji
	}is
	narrowly  restricted
	 to
	a meaning
	of obligation,
	while it
	is a
	verbal auxiliary.
	When it
	is a
	complementizer, however,
	it and
	its cognates .in

	creoles express
	irrealis meaning

	In fact,
	the IOC
	position is
	far from
	clear-cut, and MC
	and SC
	seem to
	have developed
	rather differently.
	According to Corne
	(p.c.),
	{\itshape pu
	}in MC
	marks a
	more definite
	future. In
	SC, on
	the other hand,
	the precise
	roles of
	{\itshape pu
	}and {\itshape a
	}are more
	vague, although
	the fact that
	only {\itshape pu
	}can occur
	in
	the scope
	of negation
	suggests that
	here,


	


	it does
	occasionally
	occur with
	{\itshape bin,
	}and it
	is tempting
	to claim
	that it
	is
	


	{\itshape pu

	starting to
	do just  what
	{\itshape (fi)n
	}did in
	IOC, i.e.,
	combine first
	of all
	with the
	anterior marker.
	Thus one
	can have
	GC /121/:
	


	

	
	


	/121/ mi
	bin fu
	nak am
	


	'I should
	have hit him'
	or 'I
	was about
	to hit
	him'
	


	

	
	


	The construction
	is not
	common in
	GC, and
	native speakers
	are more or
	less evenly
	divided as
	to which
	gloss is
	the more
	appropriate.
	


	Thus, in
	basilectal GC,
	with a
	classic TMA
	system, only
	a slight increase 
	in  the 
	semantic  range 
	of {\itshape Ji
	}and  in
	the syntactic
	privileges  of
	


	occurrence  is 
	needed  for 
	the  situation 
	to  begin   to 
	approximate  that
	of SC
	and MC.
	All we
	have to
	assume is
	that a
	process which
	is begin\-ning
	in GC
	(and which
	must be
	latent in
	any creole
	since all
	creoles, presumably- the
	  most   drudgingly  
	comprehensive   grammars
	  are  
	all too often
	silent on
	this score-have
	 an 
	auxiliary  of
	obligation  which 
	is ipso
	factq +irrealis)
	has been
	taken a
	stage or
	two further
	in IOC, languages
	which we
	already know 
	have  a 
	predilection  for 
	expanding and
	complicating  Aux.
	


	The rest
	of the
	story is
	simple. As
	{\itshape pu
	}was
	graduating as
	a full&shy;
	fledged competitor
	to the
	original irrealis
	{\itshape a,
	(fi)n
	}was  distorting  the
	classic system
	in such
	a way
	that the
	irrealis scope
	of both
	markers, {\itshape a
	}and {\itshape pu,
	}was losing
	some of
	its conditional
	functions
	and thus
	was getting
	closer to
	a simple
	future. In
	any case,
	when any
	two mor&shy;
	phemes divide
	the semantic
	terrain of
	&quot;future,&quot;
	it is
	a highly
	natural development that
	they should
	mark out
	their boundaries
	in some
	way, and that
	those boundaries,
	while often
	vague, should
	generally dis&shy;
	tinguish relatively
	likely from
	relatively unlikely
	events (cf.
	the discus&shy;
	sion of
	{\itshape go
	}versus
	{\itshape gon,
	}HCE's
	ft'tst
	ni,esolectal
	replacement, Bickerton
	


	We  have 
	now  seen 
	how  two
	very  natural 
	developments  could
	


	have turned
	a classic
	creole TMA
	system into
	the kind
	of system
	we see  in 
	IOC  today.
	IOC scholars
	will doubtless
	object  that 
	the account I
	have given
	is a
	purely conjectural
	one. That
	may be;
	but if
	it is
	con\-jectural, that
	is only
	because those
	scholars have
	not done
	the job
	of tracing the
	diachronic development
	of IOC through
	synchronic  resi&shy;
	dues, as
	was done
	in Bickerton
	(1975)
	for GC.
	The most
	anyone can
	do who
	does not
	have direct
	and unlimited
	access to
	the IOC
	commun\-ity is
	to show
	that similar
	developments have
	occurred or
	are occurring
	elsewhere in
	other creoles,
	which I
	have done.
	There is
	thus a
	prima fade case
	for the
	scenario outlined 
	above;  conclusive
	 evidence 
	can only come
	through the
	patient sifting 
	of  the 
	highly  variable 
	data about which
	all IOC
	scholars have
	complained,  hut 
	which  none 
	of them have
	yet exploited.
	


	

	
	


	We can
	now turn
	to our
	final deviation-the
	split between
	habi\-tuals
	and progressives
	which, according
	to Taylor
	(1971),
	conflates the
	former with
	the &quot;completive&quot;
	(in. the
	present terminology,
	zero\-marked past
	punctuals)  in JC
	and HC
	and with
	the &quot;future&quot;
	(in the present
	terminology, irrealis)
	in CR
	and ST.
	Again,
	as with
	anterior versus past
	marking, we
	must first
	ask ourselves
	if the
	data on
	which such claims
	are made
	are valid.
	Again,
	we must
	answer that
	at least sometimes
	they are
	not.
	


	For example,
	Hall (1953:31)
	describes the
	HC aspect
	marker {\itshape ap(
	e)
	}as
	&quot;indicating 
	action which 
	is continuing, 
	not  yet 
	complete, or future&quot;-in
	other  words,
	{\itshape a:p(e)
	
	}does
	not  include 
	habituals.  This,
	if true,
	would indicate
	that the
	HC system
	is not
	a classic
	TMA system since
	in  that 
	system the 
	nonpunctual  category
	 embraces
	both  con-

	tinuing and
	habitual actions.
	However, the
	First Law
	of Creole
	Studies enables us
	to find,
	in Hall's
	own texts,
	numerous sentences
	in which {\itshape ap(e)

	Although some

	be  disposed of
	in this

	remains, as
	with anteriors,
	a residue
	of cases
	where genuine

	be resolved.
	In this

	a new

	chapter.	Â·
	


	For the
	present, then,
	we can
	conclude that
	the bulk
	of so-called
	


	&quot;counterexamples&quot; to
	our analysis
	of creole
	TMA systems
	arises from one
	of the
	three following
	sources:
	<ol>
		<li/>



		Inadequate  data-gathering
		 and/or 
		acceptance  of 
		inaccurate data and/or
		faulty analysis
		of data.
		<li/>


A
		 slightly
		longer  than
		normal antecedent

	tion, allowing pidgin
	features to
	become fixed.

	<ol start="3">

		Linguistic change,
		internal or
		contact-stimulated,
		subsequent to
		creolization.
	</ol>
	


	

	
	


	In one
	or two
	cases, (2)
	would
	distort the
	normal process
	of creoliza&shy;
	tion, although
	we must
	note that
	only syntactic,
	and not
	semantic, aspects of
	that process
	are affected:
	PP {\itshape lo
	}and CR
	{\itshape ba
	}retain
	their predicted meanings,
	even though
	they do
	not assume
	their predicted
	place in
	sentence structure.
	Being a
	subsequent development,
	(3)
	cannot have
	any relevance
	to the
	process of
	creolization itself.
	As for (1),
	one can
	only hope
	that this
	will disappear
	as the
	field continues to
	develop.
	


	

	
	


	Finally, I
	shall
	examine three
	types of
	complementation in
	creoles: complements
	of perception
	verbs; factive,
	nonfactive, and
	related complement
	structures; and
	&quot;serial verb&quot;
	structures. My
	aim in doing
	so will
	be twofold.
	First ,
	as in
	the previous
	sections of
	this chapter, I
	shall seek
	to show
	that substantial
	identities of
	structure
	exist throughout
	creoles, even
	where these
	may be
	masked by
	ongoing change processes
	or other
	factors. But
	Ialso
	want to
	establish certain
	facts about
	the nature
	of creole
	syntax-facts which
	will assume
	a greater
	significance when
	we meet
	them again
	in Chapters
	3 and
	4.
	


	In English,
	the complements
	of perception
	verbs consist
	of onfinite sentences
	from which
	aspectual
	markers are
	excluded, and
	e
	subjects
	of which
	have
	underaone raising:
	<sup>1</sup><sup>6</sup>
	


	

	
	


	/125/ 
	I saw
	him leaving
	the building.
	


	./126/
	We can
	hear them
	play trombones.
	


	/127 {\itshape I
	}*I saw
	he leaving
	the building.
	


	/128/ 
	*I saw
	him was
	leaving the
	building.
	


	:129/ *We
	can hear
	them have
	played trombones.
	


	

	
	


	hile a
	superficially similar
	sentence, /130/,
	is grammatical,
	it does
	not contain a
	perception-verb
	complement, but
	a factive 
	complement  that
	has undergone 
	complementizer  deletion:

	/137{\itshape I

	<sup>CREOLE</sup>	101


	


	

	
	


	In  creoles, 
	perception-verb  
	complements  are
	
	fmite, can
	
	contain aspect
	markers, and
	have subjects
	which do
	not undergo
	raising:
	


	

	
	


	/132/ GC:
	mi hia
	dram a
	nak
	


	Ihear
	drum ASP
	beat
	


	'I
	heard
	drums beating'
	


	/133/
	GC: dem
	sii
	ikom
	


	'They
	saw him
	come'
	


	

	
	


	Although one
	might be
	tempted to
	gloss /132/
	as 'I
	heard {\itshape that
	}drums
	were beating'-along
	the lines
	of /130/-such
	a gloss
	would be
	incorrect;
	


	Â£active  complements 
	are  introduced 
	by  the 
	obligatory  particle
	 {\itshape se,}
	


	which we
	shall return
	to later:
	


	

	
	


	/134/ GC:
	mi hia
	{\itshape se
	}drom a
	nak
	


	'I
	heard THAT
	drums were
	beating'
	


	

	
	


	In /133/,
	the nominative
	case of
	the 3rd
	pers. sing.
	pronoun is
	obliga&shy;
	tory; the
	accusative case
	is ungrammatical:
	


	

	
	


	/135/  GC: 
	*dem sii
	am kom
	


	

	
	


	Free occurrence
	of nonpunctual-aspect
	{\itshape a
	}and the
	ungrammaticality  of
	an accusative
	form such
	as would
	result from
	raising indicate
	that the
	


	GC will
	allow the
	equivalent of
	/136/,
	but not
	of /137/:
	


	

	
	


	/138/
	mi
	hia
	bi!
	a
	sing
	


	/139/ 
	*mi hia
	a
	sing
	


	

	
	


	It is
	characteristic of
	languages in
	general that
	while they
	may allow zero
	subjects in
	nonfinites, they
	cannot freely
	delete subjects
	in finite clauses,
	except of
	course under
	identity, which
	does not
	apply here.
	


	A second
	argument involves
	the Propositional
	Island Constraint
	(PIC) as
	proposed by
	Chomsky (1977).
	The PIC
	affects structure of
	the form:
	


	

	
	


	/140/
	.
	.
	.x
	..
	'(.l([.
	..y
	.
	..j
	.
	..x
	.
	..
	



	
	


	and prevents
	any rule
	from moving
	a constituent
	from position
	Y to either
	position X
	just in
	case {.l(
	marks a
	finite clause.
	Let us
	assume that,
	ignoring   some  
	nonrelevant    details,
	  the  
	structure   underlying
	  both
	


	/132/
	and its English
	equivalent is
	something like
	/141/:
	<sup>1</sup><sup>7</sup>
	


	/141/	<sub>s</sub>
	


	


	<sup>NP	</sup><sup>AUX	</sup>VP
		<p align="left" style="margin-left: 0in; line-height: 0.35in">l				I		<sup>I	</sup><sup>Past	</sup>v	s		mi<sub>	I</sub>	

	embedded sentences
	in /132/
	and /133/
	are fmite.
	At least
	two further
	


	arguments point
	in a
	similar direction.
	


	In English
	perception-verb
	complements, it
	is
	possible not
	merely to
	raise the
	subject of
	the embedded
	S, but
	also to
	delete it. Thus,
	alongside /136/
	we can
	have /137/:
	


	

	
	


	/136/ I
	heard Bill
	singing.
	


	hear hia

	In the
	case of
	the English
	version of
	/132/, this
	would yield
	a derived
	structure something
	like /142/:
	


	/142/	<sup><u>s</u></sup><sup><u>
	    </u></sup><sup><u>
	</u></sup>
	
	

	
	


	NP	AUX	<sup>VP</sup>
	


	I	I
	


	I	<sup>Past</sup><sub>	</sub><sub>I</sub>
	


	hear	drumsÂ·   beating
	



	
	


	

	
	


	However, in
	the case
	of the
	GC version
	of /132/,
	/141/
	would represent
	the superficial
	as well
	as the
	underlying structure.
	


	If we
	have ana1yzed
	these sentences
	correctly, then
	it
	should be
	


	possible to
	extract from
	the circled
	node in
	/142/,
	since such
	a move
	does not
	violate the
	PIC, but
	impossible to
	extract from
	the circled node
	in /141/,
	which would
	constitute such
	a violation
	since  the
	lower S
	dominates a
	finite clause.
	Extraction from
	/142/
	is
	fine:
	


	

	
	


	/143/
	It was drums
	that I
	heard beating.
	


	/144/
	What did
	I hear
	beating?
	


	/145/
	The drums
	that I
	heard beating
	never stopped.
	


	

	
	


	Extraction  from
	the circled 
	node  of
	/ 141/,
	however, yields
	only sen-.
	tences which
	are ungrammatical
	in GC:
	


	

	
	


	/146/
	
	*a
	dram
	mi
	hia
	a
	nak
	


	/147/ *a

	nak?
	


	/148/ *di
	drom-dem we
	mi hia
	a nak
	neva stap
	


	

	
	


	Since there
	is no
	other possible
	reason for
	the ungrammaticality
	of these sentences,
	we can
	only conclude
	that they
	are ungrammatical
	because they
	violate the
	PIC, and
	that +herefore
	the embedded
	sentence in /132/
	is a
	finite one.
	


	CREOLE<sub>	103</sub>
	


	

	
	


	Very few
	writers on
	creoles have
	discussed perception-verb
	com\-plements
	specifically, and
	fewer still
	have even
	attempted to
	ana!yze them. Thus,
	the most
	that can
	be done
	at present
	is to
	point to
	a wide range
	of superficially
	similar structures
	and hope
	that scholars
	in the various
	regions will
	determine whether
	they show
	the same
	constraints on subject
	deletion and
	extraction as
	did the
	GC examples,
	Similar structures are
	found in
	other English
	creoles, such 
	as
	Belize  Creole
	(BC); in
	French creoles,
	such as
	HC and
	Guyanais (GU);
	and in
	Portu\-guese creoles
	like
	ST:
	


	

	
	


	/149/ BC: 
	ionli
	si di
	tar a
	flo:t ina

	'He
	only saw
	the tar
	floating (lit.,
	tar was
	floating) in
	the boiling

	/150/

	'He saw
	me swimming
	(lit., I
	was swimming)'
	


	

	
	


	Before leaving
	perception-verb
	complements, we
	should note
	that there are
	also some
	similar constructions
	which are
	nonfmite in
	English but clearly
	finite in
	at least
	one English
	creole, GC;
	for example,
	causative imperatives:
	


	

	
	


	/153/
	mek
	igowe
	


	'Make
	him leave'
	


	/154/
	*mek
	am
	gowe
	


	/155/

	mek

	'Don't prevent

	/156/ *na
	mek am
	na wok
	


	

	
	


	Note the
	impossibility of
	clefting such
	sentences in
	GC:
	


	

	
	


	{157{\itshape j
	
	}I
	prevented him
	from working.
	


	/158/
	It was
	him that
	Iprevented

	/159/
	mi mek
	ina
	wok
	


	/160/
	*a imi
	mek na
	wok
	


	

	
	


	Example /160/
	is
	so bad
	that it
	is almost
	unpronounceable. However,
	the restriction
	does not
	apply to
	clefting per
	se since
	the subject
	NP may undergo
	the process:
	


	

	
	


	/161/
	a mi
	mek i na
	wok
	


	'It was
	Iwho
	prevented him
	from working'
	


	

	
	


	The fact
	that complements
	of perception
	and causation
	verbs appear
	to constitute
	finite sentences
	in creoles suggests
	the possibility that
	there might
	be no
	such thing
	as a
	nonfinite structure
	in these
	languages. In
	fact,
	Idoubt
	whether there
	is any creole
	extant for
	which such an
	extreme statement
	would be
	true. However,
	there is
	a good deal
	of evidence
	which suggests
	that at
	their earliest
	stage of
	develop\-ment
	creoles may
	not have
	had any
	nonfinite strnctures.
	



	
	


	

	
	


	It should
	have become
	apparent by
	now that
	we are
	not going
	to get very
	far with
	the study
	of creoles-or
	of child
	language acquisition,
	or of
	language origins-if
	we allow
	ourselves to
	remain trapped
	within the
	static, antiprocessual
	framework which
	has dominated
	linguistics since de
	Saussure. The
	emergence of
	creole languages
	is a
	process; language
	acquisition is
	a process;
	the original
	growth and
	development of human
	language was
	assuredly a
	process. To
	apply to
	processes those
	methods expressly
	designed to
	handle static-synchronic
	systems is simply
	absurd; in
	order to
	do this,
	you have
	to pretend
	that a
	process
	


	'
	


	<sup>CREOLE</sup>	105
	



	
	


	is a
	state, and
	ignore exactly
	those characteristics
	that render
	it
	distinc\-tive.
	Such a
	procedure is
	sometimes defended
	as an
	&quot;idealization,&quot;
	cf. Chomsky and
	Halle (1968:Chapter
	8), but
	the difference
	between &quot;idealization&quot;
	and &quot;convenient
	fiction&quot; seems
	not to
	be grasped
	by these authors.
	In fact,
	static
	generativism, the
	only kind
	we have
	had so far
	(although there
	is
	no a
	priori reason
	why there
	should not
	be a dynamic
	generativism),
	has ignored
	creoles, ignored
	language origins,
	and in
	the case  of
	language
	acquisition-something it
	could hardly
	ignore since
	the mystery
	of language
	acquisition was what
	it was originally
	set
	up to
	explain-it has
	intervened with
	the sole
	result of
	turning off
	90 percent
	of the
	workers in
	the field,
	as we
	shall see
	in the next
	chapter.
	


	

	
	


	If
	we are
	going to
	call
	a
	spade a
	spade and
	a
	process a
	process, we
	need to
	make some
	basic assumptions.
	One is
	that previous
	changes in any
	language inevitably
	leave their
	footprints behind
	them (Givan 1971).
	Another is
	that diachronic
	changes must
	be directly
	reflected in synchronic
	variation (Weinreich,
	Labov and
	Herzog 1968;
	Bailey 1973;
	Bickerton
	1975). Equipped
	with  these, we
	shall examine
	other types of
	complementation in
	creoles to
	determine whether
	the current state
	of affairs
	in perception-verb
	and causative
	constructions may
	at one time
	have been
	that of
	all complement
	types.
	


	First let
	us look
	at
	a
	set of
	sentences which
	might appear
	to contain
	complementizers. In
	GC, there
	are three
	forms that
	migh t
	be
	taken for
	complementizers:
	{\itshape se,
	go,
	}and {\itshape ful
	fi.
	}We have
	already glanced at
	the second
	two in
	connection with
	the realized/nonrealized
	com\-plement
	distinction. The
	first, {\itshape se,
	}introduces
	complements of
	verbs of reporting
	and &quot;psychological&quot;
	verbs:
	


	

	
	


	/162/
	itaak
	se
	ina
	si
	am
	


	'He said
	that he
	didn't see
	it'
	


	/163/
	i
	tel
	mi
	se
	ina
	si
	am
	


	'He told
	me that
	he didn't see
	it'
	


	/164/
	mi no
	se ina
	si am
	


	'I know
	that he
	didn't see
	it'
























	


	106	ROOTS
	OF
	LANGUAGE
	


	

	
	


	Clearly, the
	complements that
	{\itshape se
	}introduces are
	finite Ss,
	just as
	are those introduced
	by Eng.
	{\itshape that.
	}However,  it
	 does
	not  follow 
	from this that
	{\itshape se
	}is a
	complementizer.
	


	Doubt arises
	in the
	first place
	because {\itshape se,
	}unlike complementizers in
	general, is
	nondeletable. A
	sentence like
	{\itshape mi
	hia
	se
	i
	a
	kom
	}means
	



	
	



	
	


	/170/ a

	'It's this
	that Iknow'
	


	/171/ dis

	only
	ungrammatical
	
	sentences:
	
	{\itshape *mi
	taak
	i
	a
	k
	om.}
	


	Further, there
	is the
	fact that
	se-clauses cannot
	be generated
	in subject position.
	In English,
	{\itshape that-clause
	s
	}can be
	generated in
	subject position  and
	 then 
	undergo  optional 
	rightward  movement
	 by 
	a  rule of
	extraposition ;
	thus, /165/
	would be
	assumed to
	be closer
	to its underlying
	structure than
	/166/,
	derived from
	the same
	underlying structure
	 via 
	extraposition:
	


	

	
	


	/165/
	That John
	has left
	isn't true.
	


	/166/
	It isn't
	true that
	John has
	left.
	


	

	
	


	However, a
	similar generalization
	could not
	be true
	for GC
	since while there
	is grammatical
	equivalent for
	/166/,
	there is
	no grammatical
	equivalent  for 
	/165/:
	


	

	
	


	{\itshape i
	}i67{\itshape I
	 
	}se
	jan
	gaan
	ua
	Ll'U
	


	il68/
	na
	tru
	se
	jan
	gaau
	



	
	


	Not only
	can se-clauses
	not be
	generated in
	subject position,
	they cannot be
	moved to
	sentence-initial position
	by any
	rule. There
	is no creole 
	passive  that 
	would  turn 
	{\itshape Everybody
	
	knows
	
	that
	
	he
	won
	
	}into
	


	'I know
	that they've
	left'
	


	/17 {\itshape 3/
	}*a se
	dem gaan
	mi no
	


	/174/  *se
	dem gaan
	a wa
	mi no
	



	
	


	True, .neither
	clefting nor
	pseudoclefting works
	in English
	either, unless
	there 1s
	a head
	noun:
	


	

	
	


	/175/
	*It's
	that they've
	left that

	/176/
	It's the
	fact that
	they've {\itshape l
	eft
	
	}that
	worries Bill.
	But English
	can front
	via topicalization:
	


	/177/
	 I
	knew  already 
	that they'd
	left.
	


	/178/ That
	they'd left
	I knew
	already.

	.	Now, it
	is true
	that this
	datum, taken
	in isolation,
	says nothing
	irectly.about
	the status
	of {\itshape se.
	}It
	merely
	suggests that

	the above

	However,  there 
	are  some 
	facts  that 
	suggest  the 
	possibility  of














	


	108	<sup>ROOTS</sup><sup>
	</sup><sup>OF</sup><sup>
	</sup><sup>LANGUAGE</sup>
	


	

	
	


	an alternative
	analysis. In
	English, there
	are
	pairs of
	sentences such
	as:
	


	

	
	


	/
	181/
	I'm
	glad
	{\itshape that
	they've
	left.}
	


	/182/
	{\itshape That
	they've
	left
	}makes
	me
	glad.
	


	

	
	


	These sentences
	are
	perhaps slightly
	less than
	synonymous, and
	they certainly would
	not be 
	regarded  as
	transformationally 
	related; since we
	have already 
	established  that
	se-clauses cannot
	be base-generated
	in subject
	position, it
	will  come 
	as no 
	surprise that 
	the GC
	equiva\-lent
	of /181/
	is grammatical,
	while the
	GC equivalent
	of /182/
	is ungrammatical:
	


	

	
	


	/183/ mi
	glad se
	dem gaan
	


	/184/ *se
	dem gaan mek
	ml glad Yet
	/185/ is
	grammatical:
	


	/185/ dem
	gaan mek
	mi glad
	


	lit., 'They've
	left CAUSE
	I glad'
	


	

	
	


	Example /185/
	cannot be 
	derived  from 
	/184/
	by se-deletion
	since, as
	we saw,
	{\itshape se
	}does
	not delete.
	It could
	only be
	derived by
	embedding S under
	{\itshape the
	}subject
	NP node.
	


	Again, these
	facts, taken
	in
	isolation, might
	not .seem
	to con&shy;
	stitute
	evidence against
	the status
	of {\itshape se
	}as a
	complementizer. Since
	we have
	already suggested
	that se-clauses
	could be
	introduced under
	Snot
	dominated by
	NP, all
	we need
	in order
	to  accommodate 
	/185/
	is a
	rule that
	will
	expand NP
	as S,
	but not
	as S.
	However, the
	picture would
	change somewhat
	if we
	could show
	one or
	both of
	two things:
	


	

	
	<ol>
		<li/>


That
		GC required
		a rule
		NP -+
		S.
	</ol>
	


	2) That
	se-clauses could
	not be
	generated under
	S.
	


	

	
	


	ln order
	to examine
	these possibilit
	\es,
	let us
	look at
	another quasi-
	


	CREOLE<sub>	109</sub>
	


	complementizer,  {\itshape fi!fu
	 
	}(henceforth 
	referred  to 
	as {\itshape fi,
	
	}for the
	 sake 
	of convenience, since
	{\itshape fi
	}is the
	more basilectal,
	if nowadays
	rarer, form
	).
	


	ln the
	GC lexicon,
	{\itshape fi
	
	}must be
	entered  both
	as a
	preposition and as
	a
	modal auxiliary
	of obligation:
	


	

	
	


	/186/ mi
	du am
	fi
	rneri, na
	fi
	ayu
	


	'I did
	it for
	Mary, not
	for you
	(pl.)'
	


	/187/ mi
	fl
	go tumara
	


	'I
	ought to
	go tomorrow'
	


	

	
	


	However, there
	are also
	sentences such
	as:
	


	

	
	


	/188/
	mi
	waan
	fi
	go
	


	'!want
	to go'
	


	/189/ mi
	waan ifi
	go
	


	'I
	want him
	to go'
	


	

	
	


	In
	/188/, {\itshape fi
	}looks
	like a
	complementizer, more
	or less
	the equivalent
	of ng.
	{\itshape to.
	}The likelihood
	that, unlike
	{\itshape se,
	fi
	}is a
	genuine cornplernentizer
	


	is rncreased 
	by  the 
	fact that
	{\itshape fi
	
	}in
	/188/
	will delete
	without  change
	of meanmg:
	


	

	
	


	/190/
	mi
	waan
	go
	


	'I want
	to go'
	


	

	
	


	. Unfortuntely,
	 /189/ 
	see'.&quot;s  at 
	first  sight 
	to  suggest 
	a  quite
	d1ffeent analysis.
	Complementizers  normally
	 precede 
	the  sentences
	they mtroduce,
	but  /191/
	is ungrammatical:
	


	

	
	


	/191/
	*mi
	waan
	fi
	igo
	


	

	
	


	Complernentizers may.

	ments,  a

	is ungrammatical:
	


	

	
	


	/192/
	*mi

	figo
	


	

	
	


	However, {\itshape ft
	}in its
	/189/
	location is
	nondeletable:
	


	

	
	


	/193/
	*mi
	waan
	i
	go
	


	CREOLE<sub>	111</sub>
	


	constituents 
	are extracted
	from Ji-clauses.
	Let us
	look first
	of all
	at
	


	a
	sentence such
	as:
	


	

	
	


	/196/
	Where did
	he want
	to go?
	This has
	the GC
	equivalent:
	


	/197/
	wisaid
	iwaan
	fi
	go?


	


	

	


	


	This contrasts
	with the  status
	of {\itshape ft
	}in
	/188/,
	and suggests
	that while
	


	{\itshape fi
	}in
	/188/
	is
	a
	complementizer,
	{\itshape fi
	}in
	1189/
	is
	a
	modal
	auxiliary.
	


	There would 
	seem to
	be  two 
	possible  analyses
	of  /188/
	
	and
	


	We  should 
	note  al<sub>so</sub><sub>
	</sub>equivalents:
	


	th<sub>a</sub>{\itshape t}
	


	

	
	


	sentences
	


	l&quot;k<sub>e</sub>
	


	<sup>/</sup><sup>
	</sup>198/
	have
	
	exact
	
	English


	


	/189/.
	In
	the
	first,
	{\itshape ft
	}is
	really
	a
	modal
	auxiliary
	in
	both
	cases-in
	/189/
	


	for
	the
	reasons
	already
	given,
	and
	in
	/188/
	because
	/188/
	is
	simply
	derived
	from
	/194/
	by
	equi-deletion
	(obligatory
	since
	/194/
	is
	un&shy;
	grammatical
	without
	it)
	:
	


	

	
	


	/194/
	*mi
	waan
	mi
	fi
	go
	


	

	
	


	This first
	solution would
	be
	tempting but
	for /190/
	:
	modal auxiliaries
	do not
	normally delete
	without loss
	of meaning.
	We might then
	wish to
	choose the
	second analysis,
	which would
	derive 1189/
	from 1195/
	via obligatory
	complementizer deletion
	 since 
	without such
	deletion /195/
	is simply
	ungrammatical:
	


	

	
	


	/195/
	*mi
	waan
	fi
	i
	fi
	go
	


	/198/
	wisaid
	i
	waan
	mi
	fi
	go?
	


	'Where did
	he want
	me to
	go?'
	



	
	


	In all
	three sentences
	/196/-/198/,
	a constituent,
	WH-piace, is
	moved out
	of an
	embedded S-in
	the case
	of /198/
	presumably  a
	tensed S.
	


	.	If
	{\itshape fi
	}in
	/198/
	is
	a
	modal
	verb,
	and
	no
	complementizer
	or
	preposic
	


	:ion.
	has been  deleted,
	/198/
	must  have
	an underlying 
	structure (ignore
	


	mg
	irrelevant
	detail)
	something
	like
	/199/:
	


	

	
	


	/199/
	


	s
	


	COMP	S


	


	

	


	


	However, there
	still lurks
	in the background
	the possibility that,
	despite
	


	1190/
	
	and
	
	/195/,
	
	the
	
	prepositional
	
	role
	of
	{\itshape ft
	}might
	
	somehow
	be
	in&shy;
	


	volved (cf.
	the claim
	by  Koopman
	and Lefebvre 
	[1981]
	that HC

	{\itshape Ji
	}&quot;can
	introduce final
	complements, either
	infinitival
	


	. .
	. or
	tensed&quot;).
	


	To  choose 
	out   of 
	these   three 
	possibilities-complementizer, modal  
	verb,  preposition-we
	 need 
	{\itshape to

	we have
	to question

	/203/:
	


	

	
	


	/206/ a
	wa na
	bin iizi
	ft
	kech ?
	


	'What was
	it that
	wasn't easy
	to catch?'
	


	

	
	


	If {\itshape fi
	}were a
	preposition in
	/203/, /203/
	and /206/
	would have
	the
	under\-lying
	struJ:;ture of
	/200/; but
	we saw
	in our
	analysis of
	/200/ that
	if WR-movement  were
	applied to
	that structure,
	a violation
	of the
	PIC
	


	would result.
	To avoid
	such violation,
	{\itshape fi
	}would
	have to
	be a
	comple&shy;
	


	mentizer, and
	/203/ and
	/206/ would
	have to
	have the
	underlying structure of
	/201/.
	Since /206/ 
	is grammatical,
	{\itshape fi
	}must 
	be a
	comple&shy;
	


	mentizer.
	


	If
	this is
	the case,
	/205/ must
	contain an
	S
	directly dominated
	by NP,
	as in
	/207 /:
	



	
	



	
	



	
	



	
	


	

	
	


	\
	


	Thus, the
	exclusion of
	se-dauses from 
	subject  position,
	 which 
	we noted in
	discussing /184/
	above,  cannot 
	be  due 
	to  the 
	absence  of 
	a
	rule rewriting
	NP as
	S
	(COMP S).
	The ungrammaticality
	of /184/
	must, therefore, result
	from the
	fact that
	{\itshape se
	}is
	not a
	complementizer, and
	consequently cannot
	be inserted
	in structures
	such as
	/207 /.
	


	We  can
	now  turn 
	to  condition 
	(2) (p.
	108).
	The  fact  that
	{\itshape se}
	


	cannot  be 
	a complementizer, 
	suggested  by 
	the  foregoing 
	analysis,
	


	;vod
	of course
	also make
	it impossible
	for
	se-dauses to
	be generated
	m
	S complements.
	But let
	us assume
	for
	the moment
	that {\itshape se
	}is a
	com\-plementizer. If
	this were
	so, .a
	sentence such
	as /208/
	below would have
	a structure
	similar to
	that of
	/201/:
	


	

	
	


	/208/ dem
	taak se
	ide
	a tong
	


	'They said
	that he
	was in
	tovm'
	


	

	
	


	In other
	words, the
	complement Swould
	contain a
	COMP node
	which ':od
	permit CO.MP-to-COMP
	WR-movement and
	hence permit
	ques\-t1onmg 
	of  the 
	nghtmost  NP, 
	We would 
	then have 
	to predict 
	that
	


	/209/ would
	be grammatical:

















	


	116	<sup>ROOTS</sup><sup>
	</sup><sup>OF</sup><sup>
	</sup><sup>LANGUAGE</sup>
	


	

	
	


	/209 {\itshape I
	}*wisaid
	dem taak
	se i
	de? 'Where did
	they say
	he was?'
	


	

	
	


	Unfortunately,  it 
	is not.
	We  can 
	therefore  only 
	conclude that
	{\itshape se
	
	}is something
	other than
	a complementizer.
	


	The third
	quasi-complementizer, {\itshape go,
	}is even
	more restricted
	than
	


	{\itshape se.
	}Like
	{\itshape se,
	}but
	unlike
	{\itshape fi,
	}it
	cannot
	be
	preposed:
	


	

	
	


	/210/ i
	tek i
	gon fi
	shuut taiga
	


	'He took
	his gun
	to shoot
	a jaguar 
	(but did
	not necessarily 
	do so)'
	


	/211/ i
	tek i
	gon go
	shuut taiga
	


	'He took
	his gun
	to shoot
	a jaguar
	(and did
	shoot one)'
	


	/212/
	fi
	shuut taiga
	i a
	tek i
	gon
	


	'For shooting
	jaguars he
	used to
	take his
	gun'<sup>1</sup><sup>8</sup>
	


	/213/ *go
	shuut taiga
	i a tek
	i gon
	


	

	
	


	Unlike both
	{\itshape fi
	
	}and {\itshape se,
	go
	}cannot
	occur with
	adjectival verbs:
	


	

	
	


	/214/
	mi glad
	fi sii
	yu
	


	'I'm glad
	to see
	you'
	


	/215/ mi
	glad se
	yu kom
	'I'm glad
	you came'
	


	/216/  *mi
	glad go
	sii yu
	


	

	
	


	As with
	{\itshape se
	
	}(but
	not {\itshape fi
	),
	}complement 
	constituents cannot
	be extracted:
	


	

	
	


	/217{\itshape I
	}i gaan
	a tong
	go sii
	dakta
	


	'He's gone
	to town
	to see
	the doctor'
	


	/218/
	*a hu
	i gaan
	a tong
	go sii?
	


	'Who did
	he go
	to town
	to see?'
	


	/219/ *di
	dakta we
	i gaan
	a tong
	go sii
	de bad
	an aal
	'The doctor
	he went
	to town
	to see
	is sick
	too'
	


	

	
	


	We can
	assume, as
	with {\itshape se,
	}that
	extraction is
	blocked because
	COMP-to&shy;
	


	'
	


	<sup>CREOLE</sup>	117
	



	
	


	COMP movement
	is impossible;
	therefore, {\itshape go
	}is not
	a complementizer
	either.
	


	The claim
	that {\itshape se
	 }is a
	serial verb
	in Krio
	has been
	argued strongly
	


	by Larimore
	(1976),
	but since
	there are
	some minor
	differences be&shy;
	tween the
	grammars of
	Krio and
	GC, not 
	all her
	arguments apply to
	the latter
	language. I
	shall assume
	without further
	argument  that {\itshape se
	}and {\itshape go
	}are
	both  serial
	verbs.  If  this 
	assumption  is
	correct, then {\itshape se
	}and {\itshape go,
	}if not
	{\itshape fi,
	}really
	belong with
	the verbs
	that we
	will discuss in
	the next
	section on
	serialization. But
	because {\itshape fi
	}may be
	a comple&shy;
	mentizer synchronically,
	it by
	no means
	necessarily follows
	that {\itshape fi
	}always was
	a complementizer.
	


	Washabaugh (1979:Example
	9) cites
	the following
	sentence: <sup>19</sup>
	


	

	
	


	/220/
	ah
	waan
	di
	rien
	kom
	fi
	ah
	don
	go
	huoam
	


	'I want
	the rain
	to come
	so that
	I won't
	have to
	go home'
	


	

	
	


	This sentence,
	from Providence
	Island Creole
	(PIC), a
	variety similar in
	many ways
	to GC,
	is of
	a type
	claimed by
	Washabaugh to
	be &quot;rare
	in most
	contemporary varieties
	of [Caribbean
	English creoles]
	, but
	. .
	. frequent enough 
	in older
	texts.&quot; Washabaugh
	does not
	analyze this
	sentence, so
	we do
	not know
	whether the
	following sentence
	would be rejected
	by Providence
	Islanders:
	


	

	
	


	/221/  ?wisaid
	ah
	waan di
	rien kom
	fi
	ah
	don go?
	


	

	
	


	It would
	almost certainly
	be rejected
	by speakers
	of other
	Caribbean English creoles.
	


	The most
	likely structure
	of /2
	20/ would
	be one
	similar to
	that
	


	of /185/,
	reproduced  here 
	for convenience:

	Here, {\itshape mek
	}functions
	rather like
	the abstract
	verb CAUSE
	once posited by
	generative semanticists.
	In
	/220/,
	{\itshape fi
	}would
	have a
	meaning something
	


	like
	SHOULD
	CAUSE,
	with
	{\itshape di

	}as
	its
	subject
	and
	{\itshape ah
	don
	go
	huoam
	}as
	its
	object.
	


	On  present 
	evidence  we 
	cannot  determine 
	for
	sure  whether
	{\itshape fi}
	


	was once
	exclusively a
	serial verb.
	However, it
	seems reasonable
	to suppose that
	in GC
	and other
	creoles, serial
	verbs may
	be turning
	into complementizers.
	Such a
	process certainly
	exists in
	some West
	African languages (Lord
	1976),
	and we
	shall shortly
	examine evidence 
	from Sranan which
	indicates
	that serial
	verbs there
	may be 
	undergoing  a
	rather similar
	kind of
	reanalysis.
	


	The boundaries
	of serial
	verb constructions
	are not
	easy to define,
	nor is
	it easy
	(or perhaps
	even desirable)
	to distinguish
	them from other
	superficially similar
	constructions
	such as
	&quot;verb
	chains&quot; (Forman
	1972).
	Here, I
	shall simply
	concern myself
	with those
	serial constructions
	which are
	equivalent to
	multi-case sentences,
	i.e., which
	mark oblique
	cases (dative,
	instrumental, etc.)
	with verbs
	rather than
	with prepositions
	or with  other
	types of
	formal devices.
	Examples of
	such structures
	would include:
	


	

	
	


	/223/
	Directionals:
	


	SR:
	a
	{\itshape wakago
	}a
	wosu
	


	he walk
	go to
	house
	


	'He walked
	home'	<sup>\</sup>
	


	'He
	cut the
	meat with
	a knife'
	


	

	
	


	Sentences such
	as /223/-/226/
	are by
	no means
	always the
	only ways in
	which those
	creoles that
	have them
	can express
	case relations.
	Alongside /226/,
	Djuka has
	/227
	/:
	


	

	
	


	/227
	/
	a
	koti
	a
	meti
	anga
	nefi
	


	he cut
	the meat
	with knife
	


	'He cut
	the meat
	with a
	knife'
	


	

	
	


	According
	to
	Huttar
	(1975),
	sentences
	like
	/227/
	occur
	more
	fre&shy;
	quently
	in
	speech
	than
	sentences
	like
	/226/.
	


	Which 
	of  such 
	pairs  represents 
	the  most 
	conservative  creole
	


	level? Serial
	verbs fonn
	a more
	marked means
	of expressing
	case rela&shy;
	tions than
	do prepositions.
	It is,
	therefore, relatively
	unlikely that
	a
	language which
	already had
	prepositions to
	mark case
	would develop
	serial verbs 
	(except in
	certain
	circumstances
	which could
	harclly  apply
	


	to creoles
	and which
	will
	be discussed
	later). On
	the other
	hand, it
	is
	


	relatively likely
	that  a
	language which
	originally had
	only serial
	verbs as a
	case-marking device
	would subsequently
	develop prepositions,
	either by
	a
	type of
	reanalysis already
	attested for
	West African
	lan\-guages (Lord
	1976),
	or by
	direct borrowing
	from a
	high-prestige lan&shy;
	guage  with 
	which  it
	was in 
	contact  (probably
	 the 
	case in
	any creole

	that has
	undergone even
	a relatively
	small amount
	of decreolization).
	We are
	therefore justified
	in assuming
	that serial
	verb constructions
	represent extremely
	conservative varieties
	of those
	creoles in
	which they are
	found.
	


	Serial verbs
	are usually
	interpreted as
	the result
	of African
	substratum influence
	on creoles,
	but creolists
	seldom if
	ever ask
	how those West
	African  languages
	 which.
	have  serial
	verbs  (by
	no means all
	of them
	) happen
	to have
	come by
	them. Despite
	lip service
	to linguistic equality,
	a dual
	standard is
	still applied
	to creoles:
	if a
	creole has a
	feature, it
	must  have
	 borrowed 
	it ;
	but  if 
	a noncreole 
	language has the 
	same  feature, 
	it is
	assumed  to
	be  an
	independent  innovation&shy;
	at least
	in the
	absence of
	clear evidence
	to  the 
	contrary.  In 
	fact, I would
	claim that
	creoles and
	West African
	languages invented
	verb serialization
	independently ,
	but  for
	slightly different
	reasons.
	


	Wherever serial
	verbs are
	found outside
	creoles, a
	change in
	word order is
	always involved 
	(see Li
	and Thompson 
	[1974]  for
	Chinese; Giv6n  [1974]
	 and
	Hyman  [1974] 
	for West
	African languages;
	Brad\-shaw
	[1979] 
	for Austronesian
	languages in
	New Guinea).
	Sometimes the
	change may
	be contact-influenced,
	as in
	New Guinea;
	sometimes it may
	come from
	purely language-internal
	developments, as
	with the
	. Kwa languages
	of West
	Africa. Precise
	explanations of
	why SOV-SVO (West
	Africa) or
	SVO-SOV (New
	Guinea) changes
	involve serialization
	are still
	controversial. Giv6n
	( 1974)
	suggests that
	serialization results
	from  the  decay
	of post
	positional case
	marking, an
	explanation chal&shy;
	lenged  by 
	Hyman  (1974); 
	Bradshaw  (1979) 
	suggests  serialization
	eases parsing
	problems in
	a period
	of transition
	by generating
	sentences that can
	be parsed
	as either
	SVO or
	SOV without
	any semantic
	confu\-sion (we
	shall return
	to this
	point at
	the end
	of Chapter
	4 ).
	However, there seems
	to be
	no serious
	ground for
	doubting that
	serialization and
	word-order  change 
	are involved 
	with  one 
	another  in
	some  kind 
	of way.
	


	Word-order change
	cannot have been
	a factor
	in creolization
	since most
	of the
	languages in
	contact, as
	well as
	the resultant creoles,
	have been
	SVO. However,
	the problem
	that word-order
	change creates&shy;
	


	'
	


	<sup>CREOLE</sup>	121
	


	

	
	


	that of
	unambiguously identifying
	case roles
	while the
	change is
	under way-must have been
	a problem
	in creolization
	too, if
	we assume
	what must almost
	certainly have
	been  the 
	case  in 
	at  least 
	some pidgins,
	i.e., that the
	latter did
	not contain
	(or at
	least did
	not  contain  a
	full range
	of) prepositions.
	Without prepositions
	and without
	inflectional morphology,
	how else
	could oblique
	cases be
	distinguished if
	not by serial
	verbs?
	


	More specific
	doubts  about 
	the viability 
	of substrata!
	accounts, as well
	as the
	seeds of
	an explanation  as
	to why
	creoles differ
	so much in
	the extent
	to which they
	exhibit serialization,
	are suggested
	by the following
	data  on 
	the  Surinam 
	creoles  (Djuka, 
	Sranan,  Saramaccan).
	In
	these
	languages, instrumental
	constructions (as
	expressed via
	equiva\-lents of
	'He cut
	the meat
	with a
	knife') have
	the following
	range:
	


	/228/ DJ: 
	a koti
	a meti
	anga nefi
	


	/229/ SR:  a
	koti a
	meti nanga
	nefi
	


	/230/  SA: 
	a koti
	di gbamba
	ku faka
	


	/231/ DJ: 
	a teke
	nefi koti
	a meti
	


	/232/ SR:
	a teki nefi
	koti a
	meti
	


	/233/ SA: 
	?a tei
	faka koti
	di gbamba
	


	A sentence
	similar to
	{\itshape /
	233/
	-a
	tei
	di
	pau
	naki
	en,
	}lit.,
	'He took
	the stick
	hit it',
	i.e.,
	'He hit
	it with
	the stick'-is
	cited in
	Grimes and
	Glock (1970)
	but footnoted
	to the
	effect that
	the authors have
	since become
	highly doubtful
	as to
	its status
	in SA.
	In Glock
	(1972),
	which deals
	explicitly with
	case phenomena,
	there is
	no mention
	of sentences
	like
	


	/233/, although
	sentences like
	/230/, as
	well as
	serialization of
	other cases, are
	cited and
	discussed; nor
	is SA
	credited with
	tei-serialization in
	Jansen, Koopman
	and Muysken
	(1978),
	although, again,
	there is
	no explicit
	discussion. It
	is thus 
	impossible  to 
	tell whether 
	Saramaccan has this
	kind of
	serialization, although
	the present 
	balance of
	evidence seems to
	be against
	it.
	


	Saramaccan is
	well known
	as being,
	among the
	three Surinam
	creoles (or,
	for that
	matter, among
	all the
	Caribbean creoles),
	the one which 
	best  preserves 
	African  lexical
	and phonological 
	characteristics

	(note, in
	the preceding
	{\itshape examples,gbamba
	}'meat',
	a word
	of presumably
	African origin
	which preserves
	the coarticulated
	and prenasalized
	stops characteristic of
	many West
	African languages
	but of
	no other
	creoles, compared with
	DJ and  SR
	{\itshape meti
	}from
	Eng. {\itshape meat).
	}This
	be.ing
	so, and
	if serial
	constructions also
	reflect African
	influence, one
	would expect
	to find that
	SA  had more
	of such
	constructions than
	 DJ
	and  SR,
	rather than
	the reverse.
	


	But while
	there is
	no explanation
	for the
	pattern in
	terms of substrate
	influence, an
	explanation can
	be provided
	in terms
	of interÂ· action
	between  the
	antecedent pidgin
	and its
	superstrate. It
	seems reasonable
	to assume
	that if
	a creole
	can acquire
	prepositions from
	its antecedent
	pidgin (as HCE
	did), it
	will not
	need to
	develop serial
	verbs for case
	marking. The
	only question
	is, why should
	some antecedent
	pidgins acquire
	prepositions while
	others do
	not?
	


	Clearly, one
	factor is
	population balance,
	while another 
	factor is the
	type of
	social  structure;
	between  them, 
	these will
	determine the
	accessibility of
	the superstrate
	language and
	hence help
	to deter\-mine
	how many
	superstrate items
	the pidgin
	will absorb.
	However, these are
	by no
	means the
	only factors
	involved. Other
	things, including social
	conditions, being
	equal, structural
	differences  between
	super\-strate
	features may
	determine whether
	a pidgin
	will or
	will not
	absorb these features.
	


	For a
	superstrate feature
	to be
	accessible to
	a pidgin,
	that feature must
	be more
	or less
	unambiguous with
	respect to
	meaning, more
	or less free
	from mutation
	with respect
	to phonological
	structure, and
	as close as
	possible to
	the canonical
	form of
	CV(CV).
	The superstrate
	prepositions of
	instrumentality available
	to the
	three languages
	were: for SR
	and DJ,
	Eng. {\itshape with;
	}for SA,
	Eng. {\itshape with
	}and Pg.
	com-phonetically, [ko] or
	[kUJ
	in many
	contemporary dialects.
	The former,
	with its initial
	semivowel (a
	marked segment)
	and fmal
	labiodental fricative
	(an extremely
	marked segment),
	is remote
	from the
	canonical pattern;
	the latter,
	in the
	form in
	which it
	is
	perhaps most
	frequently realized,
	fits it
	exactly. The
	relative difficulty
	of acquiring
	{\itshape com
	}and
	{\itshape with
	}may best
	be pictured
	if
	the reader
	imagines that
	his linguistic
	competence
	


	\
	


	<sup>CREOLE</sup>	123
	


	

	
	


	is limited
	to African
	languages and
	then attempts
	to segment
	the following synonymous
	utterances:
	


	

	
	


	/234/ vai
	corn aquele
	homem
	


	/235/ go
	with that
	man
	


	

	
	


	Word boundaries
	in the
	Portuguese utterance
	are fairly
	un\-ambiguously
	marked; in
	the English
	one, it would
	be hard
	to determine
	where the
	verb ended
	and the
	preposition began,
	or where
	the preposi&shy;
	tion ended
	and the
	demonstrative began-or
	even to
	be sure
	that there
	was a
	preposition there
	at all.
	It is
	hardly  surprising,
	therefore, that
	neither Sranan
	nor J:1uka
	could absorb
	{\itshape with,
	}but had
	to adopt
	a serializ&shy;
	ing device
	in order
	to express
	instrumentality, and
	that only
	later did they  
	develop   their  
	own  preposition,
	{\itshape (n)anga,
	
	}of 
	uncertain  origin;
	


	whereas, on
	the other
	hand, Sararnaccan,
	like all
	Portuguese creoles,
	easily acquired
	{\itshape ku
	}and
	thus did not
	need a
	serial construction
	for instrumentality.
	


	The underlying
	structure of
	serial-verb constructions
	has been
	a subject of
	some controversy
	(see Williams
	[ l971,
	197
	5] ,
	Roberts [1975],
	Voorhoeve [1975],
	Jansen, Koopman
	and Muysken 
	[1978] for
	some differing
	views on
	this subject).
	I suspect
	that varying
	analyses are due
	at least
	in part
	to inherent
	conflicts in
	the data,
	and that
	these conflicts, in
	turn, are
	due to
	ongoing developments
	in creoles
	which have the
	result of
	complicating the
	original creole
	syntax and
	intro\-ducing
	categories which
	formed no
	part of
	the original
	grammar. If we
	are to
	understand what
	creoles are,
	and make
	comparisons between
	particular creoles
	without allowing
	ourselves to
	be misled
	by sub\-sequent and
	irrelevant accretions,
	we must-to
	cite the
	words of
	Koop\-man
	and Lefebvre,
	on which  I
	could not
	hope to
	improve-&quot;restrict
	the notion
	of syntactic
	expansion to
	changes leading
	to the
	acquisition
	of features
	that are
	part of
	core grammar
	up to
	the time
	of creolization
	and to
	consider the
	emergence of
	other features
	as regular
	cases of syntactic
	change&quot; (Koopman
	and Lefebvre
	1981:218).
	


	Koopman  and
	Lefebvre assume,
	as I
	do, that
	pidgins begin
	with

	nouns, verbs,
	and very
	little else.
	They assume
	that VP
	is a
	pidgin category, but
	do not
	defend it
	as such.
	For reasons
	given in
	the dis&shy;
	cussion of
	GC movement
	rules above,
	I do
	not think
	VP is
	a category in
	most early
	creoles, although
	of course
	creoles may
	acquire it
	later, either through
	decreolization or
	regular syntactic
	change (reanalysis).
	The only
	rule creoles
	would then
	require to
	generate any
	of the
	comple\-ment  types,
	 serial 
	or  other, 
	discussed  so
	far (with
	the exception
	of
	


	/i-clauses)
	would be
	/236/:
	


	

	
	


	/236/ S

	Aux V
	(NP) (S)
	


	

	
	


	If in
	fact VPs
	were developed
	initially, two

	be required:

	In /241/
	and /243/,
	some speakers
	can extract
	the most
	deeply embed&shy;
	ded NP,
	while others
	cannot.  In /244/,
	a rule
	similar to
	the GC
	verb\-focusing rule
	copies the
	higher  of 
	the  two 
	verbs,  for 
	all  speakers; but
	in /245/,
	while some
	speakers can
	copy the
	more deeply
	embedded verb,  others
	cannot.
	


	These facts
	can be
	accounted for
	if we 
	assume that
	the two sets
	of speakers
	have different
	types of
	underlying structures
	for these
	sentences, as
	represented in
	/246/ and
	/247/,
	respectively:


	


	

	


	


	Not a
	great deal
	depends on
	which analysis
	is correct
	; therefore,
	since crucial
	evidence will
	be taken
	from Sranan,
	and since
	Sranan scholars generally
	assume a
	VP  (although, once
	again, without
	explicit discussion), I
	shall accept
	/237 {\itshape I
	}and 
	/238/  as 
	specifying  the 
	earliest and most 
	basic  level of
	creole syntax,
	while  continuing
	to suspect
	that
	


	/236/ may
	be a
	more accurate
	representation of
	it.
	


	The evidence
	consists of
	judgments by
	native speakers
	of Sranan cited in
	Jansen, Koopman
	and Muysken
	(1978). The
	parenthesized asterisks
	before certain
	sentences indicate
	that while
	some speakers
	found them
	grammatical, others
	did not.

	Greg Lee
	(p.c.)
	has pointed
	out that
	there is
	an alternative
	solution
	which does
	not involve
	positing two
	different underlying
	structures: the
	two sets
	of speakers
	could have
	different rule
	orderings for extraction
	and Equi.
	If the
	f1rst
	
	set  ordered
	 extraction 
	before Equi,
	the  lower occurrence
	of {\itshape Kofi
	}would still
	be undeleted
	when extraction applied,
	the S-node
	would remain
	unpruned, and
	the SSC and
	PIC would
	still apply.
	If the
	second set
	ordered Equi
	before ex&shy;
	traction, the
	offending S-node
	would be
	pruned to
	give /247
	/ as
	a derived
	structure, and
	no constraints
	would then
	inhibit movement.
	


	This is
	true, but
	it means
	that both
	sets of
	speakers would
	then
	


	have the
	more primitive
	phrase-structure
	rules-/237/ and
	/238/-that
	


	\
	


	which rule
	ordering is
	crucial.
	


	

	
	


	A
	second set
	of native-speaker
	judgrnents concerns
	Sranan directional
	constructions, for
	example /223/,
	repeated here
	for
	conveni\-ence
	as
	/249/:
	


	

	
	


	/249/ a
	waka go
	a wosu
	


	he walk
	go to
	house 'He walked
	home'
	


	

	
	


	Here, in
	contrast with
	the previous
	examples, there
	are no
	disagree\-ments;
	either verb
	can be
	fronted by
	the same
	verb-focusing rule

	Finally ,
	Sranan speakers
	disagree again
	over sentences
	involving datives and
	benefactives expressed
	with {\itshape gi,

	an independent

	a

	meaning 'give'.
	Differences may be
	illustrated  by the
	following sentences:
	


	and such
	speakers must
	have rule
	/248/.
	The verb-focusing
	rule that applies
	in  /258/ 
	cannot  front 
	prepositions,  so,
	 again, 
	those  who 
	find

	consider {\itshape gi
	
	}as  a

	 those who

	Differences of

	If the
	first of
	these stages
	represents the
	most primitive
	level of
	creole development, as
	we have
	given reason
	to believe,
	then the
	data shown here,
	drawn from
	a {\itshape synchronic
	}analysis
	of Sranan
	verb serialization,
	represent at
	the same
	time  the {\itshape diachronic
	development
	}of
	Sranan, from an
	original state
	in
	which presumably
	all serial
	verbs were
	full verbs in
	tensed sentences
	to a
	stage in
	which these
	verbs are
	beginning to be
	reduced to
	mere prepositions.
	Note that
	this process
	serves to bring
	Sranan structurally
	closer to
	the high-prestige
	language, Dutch,
	with which
	it
	has been
	in
	continuous contact
	for over
	three centuries.
	


	Thus, there
	is good
	reason for
	claiming, across
	creole languages
	generally, that
	the vast
	majority of
	embedded sentences
	are finite
	and tensed, and
	that where
	exceptions to
	this generalization
	can be
	found, they constitute
	developments that
	have taken
	place subsequent
	to creolization.
	The second
	half of
	this claim
	would be
	hard to
	prove con&shy;
	vincingly because
	of the
	inaccessibility of
	evidence; but
	I know
	of neither facts
	nor arguments
	that would
	point in
	an opposite
	direction.
	


	With regard to
	the types
	of complementation
	featuring serial
	verbs, it
	would seem
	that the
	strongest constraint
	on such
	develop\-ments was
	the availability
	of superstrate
	prepositions for
	case-marking purposes.
	Where prepositions
	were available,
	even if
	African influence
	was strong
	(as with
	Saramaccan), they
	would be
	chosen over
	serial models. In
	the absence
	of superstrate
	prepositions,
	serialization would
	always be
	chosen. I
	suspect that
	it \\\as
	reinvented, rather
	than selected,
	


	CREOLE<sub>	</sub><sub>1</sub><sub>31</sub>
	


	

	
	


	in most  if
	not all
	cases; but
	if not,
	if it
	was indeed
	selected out
	of a range
	of substrate
	alternatives, the
	present theory
	would remain
	un\-affected. This
	theory claims
	that verb
	serialization is
	the only
	answer to the
	problem of
	marking cases
	in languages
	which have
	only N
	and V as
	major categories.
	Thus, if
	such
	structures were
	selected from
	a substratum, they
	were selected
	because they
	offered the
	only answer, not
	merely because
	they happened
	to be
	present in
	the substratum;
	and, in
	those cases
	where they  were
	not present 
	in the
	substratum (as may
	have been
	the case
	in creoles
	that drew
	heavily on
	Guinean or Bantu
	rather than
	Kwa languages),
	readers of
	Chapter 1
	should have little
	doubt as  to
	the power
	of creole
	children to
	invent such
	structures, should
	the language
	they were
	developing require
	these.
	


	However, before
	leaving serial
	verbs, a
	word is
	in order
	on HCE.
	Substratomaniacs will
	naturally wish
	to attribute
	the absence
	of serial&shy;
	verb constructions
	in HCE
	to the
	absence of
	an African
	substratum rather than
	to the
	presence of
	prepositions. In
	fact, though
	no true serial
	constructions have  developed
	as a
	consistent part
	of the
	syn\-chronic grammar,
	sporadic residues
	of such
	constructions are
	to be found
	both  in synchronic
	speech and
	in the
	literature, For
	instance, instrumental
	and directional
	uses of
	verbs would
	occur occasionally
	in the
	speech of
	the very
	oldest HCE
	speakers:
	


	

	
	


	/263/ dei
	wan get
	naif pok
	yu
	


	'They want
	to stab
	you with
	a knife'
	


	/264/  dei
	wawk fit
	go skul they
	walk feet
	go school
	


	'They
	went to
	school on
	foot'
	


	

	
	


	Moreover, decreolization
	in Hawaii
	began so
	early and 
	progressed so rapidly
	that there
	is good
	reason to 
	believe  that 
	other  similar 
	forms were already
	lost by
	the early
	seventies. For
	instance, in
	basilectal GC,
	{\itshape take
	it
	}and
	{\itshape bring
	it
	}are
	regularly rendered  as
	{\itshape ker
	am
	go  }(lit.,
	'carry it go')
	and {\itshape bing
	am
	kom,
	}a fact
	usually explained
	by pointing
	to a
	similar structure  in
	Yoruba.

	We have
	now surveyed
	a wide
	range of
	creole structures
	across a number
	of unrelated
	creole languages.
	We have
	seen that
	even taking into
	account the,
	in some
	cases, several
	centuries
	of time
	that have
	elapsed since
	creolization, and
	the heavy
	pressures  undergone
	 by those
	creoles (a
	large majority
	) that
	are still
	in
	contact with
	their superstrates, these
	languages show
	similarities
	which go
	far beyond.

	of coincidental
	resemblance, and
	which  are
	not explicable in
	terms of
	conventional transmission
	processes such
	as diffusion
	or substratum influence
	(the ad
	hoe nature
	of the
	latter should
	be ade&shy;
	quately demonstrated
	by the
	opportunism of
	those who
	attribute a
	structure to
	Yoruba when
	it appears
	in the
	Caribbean and
	to Chinese when
	it appears
	in Hawaii).
	Moreover, we
	fmd that
	the more
	we strip creoles
	of their
	more recent
	developments, the
	more we
	factor out
	superficial and
	accidental fearures,
	the greater
	are the
	similarities that
	reveal themselves.
	Indeed, it
	would seem
	reasonable to
	suppose that
	the only differences
	among creoles
	at creolization
	were those
	due to
	differences in
	the nature
	of the
	antecedent pidgin,
	in particular
	to the extent
	to which
	superstrate features
	had been
	absorbed by
	that pidgin
	and were 
	therefore  directly
	 accessible 
	to  the 
	first creole
	generation in the
	outputs  of their
	pidgin-speaking
	parents. Finally,
	the overall
	pattern of
	similarity which
	emerges from
	this chapter
	is entirely
	conso\-nant with
	the process
	of building
	a language
	from the
	simplest consti&shy;
	tuents-in
	many cases,
	no more
	than S,
	N, and
	V, the
	minimal consti-
	tuents necessary

	pidgin.	,

	In theory,
	given these
	basic constituents,
	there are
	perhaps not
	infinitely many
	but certainly
	a very
	large number
	of ways
	in which, one
	might suppose,
	a viable
	human language
	could be
	built-at least
	as many
	ways as
	there are
	different kinds
	of human
	language. This
	would certainly
	be the
	conclusion to
	which any
	existing school
	of linguistic theory
	would lead
	one. It
	would, however,
	be an
	incorrect conclusion. The
	fact that
	there appears
	to be
	only one way
	of building up
	a language
	(with some,
	but relatively
	few and
	minor variations,
	of course) strongly
	suggests that
	when this
	problem was
	originally faced.,
	whether thirty
	thousand years
	or thirty
	thousand centuries
	ago, it might
	have had
	to be
	solved in
	a very
	similar way,
	and we
	shall further
	explore this
	possibility in
	Chapter 4.
	


	Our original
	aim in
	this chapter
	was to
	show that
	the &quot;inven&shy;
	tions&quot; of
	HCE speakers
	illustrated in
	Chapter 1
	were not
	peculiar to them,
	but followed
	a regular
	pattern of
	&quot;invention&quot;
	which emerged
	wherever human
	beings  had 
	to  manufacture 
	an adequate
	language in short
	order from
	inadequate materials.
	 Now, if
	all children
	can indeed do
	this-and it
	would be
	bizarre indeed
	if the
	capacity developed
	only when
	it was
	needed-they can
	only do
	so as the
	result of
	the factor
	which is
	responsible for
	all species-specific
	behavior: genetic
	trans\-mission of
	the bioprogram
	for the
	species.
	


	The idea
	that there
	is a
	bioprogram
	for human 
	(and other
	spe\-cies) {\itshape physical
	}development
	is wholly
	uncontroversial. No
	one supposes that
	human beings
	have to
	learn to
	breathe,  eat, 
	yell  when 
	they  are hurt,
	stand upright,
	or flex
	the muscles
	of finger 
	and thumb
	into what is
	the purely
	human, species-specific
	&quot;precision
	grip.&quot; We
	speak of
	children &quot;learning
	to walk,&quot;
	and  we 
	characteristically  help
	 them 
	in their first
	stumbling efforts,
	hut no
	one seriously
	imagines that
	if
	we neglected to
	do  this, the
	child would
	go crawling
	into maturity.
	The term &quot;learning&quot;
	is used
	here in
	a purely
	metaphorical sense.
	


	Yet the
	idea that
	there is
	a
	bioprogram for
	human {\itshape mental
	}de\-velopment
	still meets
	with massive
	resistance, despite
	the fact
	that Piaget and
	his disciples have
	shown how
	human cognitive
	development unrolls in
	a series
	of predetermined
	and invariant
	stages,2 <sup>1</sup><sup>

	of

	control
	simply
	cannot
	be
	turned
	on
	and
	off
	.in
	this
	way.
	Therefore,
	if
	our
	theory
	is

	it

	be
	the

	that
	the

	Briefly,

	the
	blueprint
	for
	lan&shy;
	guage
	with
	which
	his
	bioprograrn
	provides
	him.
	We
	should
	note
	from
	the
	outset
	that
	there
	are
	numerous
	differences
	between
	the

	and
	earlier

	that

	One
	point
	that
	should
	be
	made
	is
	that
	in

	the

	is
	not

	to
	&quot;know&quot;

	that
	might
	mean-any
	more
	than
	we
	would
	suppose
	that
	
	a
	child
	at
	birth,
	or
	even
	at

	months,
	&quot;knows&quot;
	how

	Rather,
	the
	bioprogram
	language
	would
	unfold,
	just
	as
	a
	pnysical
	bioprogram
	unfolds;
	the
	language
	would
	grow
	just
	as
	the
	body
	grows,
	presenting
	the
	appropriate
	structures
	at
	the
	appropriate
	times
	and
	in
	the
	appropriate,
	pre-programmed
	sequences
	(I
	shall
	have
	more
	to
	say
	about
	the
	mechanisms
	by
	which
	this
	might
	be
	accomplished
	when
	we
	come
	to
	Chapter
	4).
	


	However,
	the
	vast
	mass
	of
	human
	children
	are
	not
	growing
	up
	in
	even
	a
	partial
	linguistic
	vacuwn.
	There
	will
	be
	a
	ready-made
	language
	which
	their
	elders
	will
	be
	determined
	that
	they
	should
	learn.
	Thus,
	almost
	(but
	not
	quite)
	from
	the
	earliest
	stages,
	the
	evolving
	bioprogram
	will
	interact
	with
	the
	target
	language.
	Sometimes

	will
	be
	very
	similar
	to
	features

	in
	which
	case
	we
	will
	fmd
	extremely
	rapid,
	early,
	and
	apparently
	effortless

	Sometimes
	the
	target
	language
	will
	have
	evolved
	away
	from
	the
	bioprogram,
	to
	a
	greater
	or
	lesser
	extent,
	and
	in
	these
	cases
	we
	will
	expect
	{\itshape to

	common
	or
	even
	systematic
	&quot;errors&quot;
	which,
	in

	will
	be
	 attributed
	to
	 &quot;incorrect
	
	hypotheses&quot;
	
	formed
	by
	the
	child,
	but
	which,
	I
	shall
	claim,
	are
	simply
	the
	result
	of
	the
	child's
	ignoring
	(because
	he
	
	is
	not
	
	ready
	
	for
	
	it}
	the
	data
	presented
	by
	speakers
	of
	the
	target
	language
	and
	following
	out
	instead
	the
	instruc&shy;
	tions
	of
	his
	bioprogram.
	


	dearly,
	then,
	it
	should
	be
	possible
	to
	examine
	existing
	studies
	of
	child
	language
	acquisition
	and
	reinterpret
	them
	in
	light
	of
	the
	theory
	outlined
	above.
	If
	that
	theory
	is

	we
	expect
	to
	find.
	a
	wide

	would
	 arise
	directly
	 from
	the

	ACQUISITION
	



	
	



	
	



	
	



	
	


	

	
	


	In recent
	work, a
	number of
	scholars (e.g., Bruner
	1979, Snow 1979)
	have summarized
	the development
	of acquisition
	studies over the
	last two
	decades. In
	the mid-sixties,
	the field,
	which had
	previously been
	atheoretical and
	somewhat underdeveloped,
	came to
	be domi\-nated
	by a
	type of
	innatist theory.
	This theory,
	derived largely
	from generative grammar,
	and in
	particular from
	works such
	.as
	Chomsky (1962),
	held that
	the child
	acquired language
	through simple
	exposure to
	linguistic data,
	much of
	which was
	&quot;degenerate&quot;
	-i.e.,
	consisted of st3n
	tence

	mid-111;1ntrncr
	reformufo

	types
	oJ
	performance error
	which would
	render natural speech
	a very
	unreliab mirror to
	mature native-speaker
	competence. Somehow the
	child had to
	sift the
	wheat from
	the chaff,
	and he
	could only
	do this,
	it wa claimed,
	if he
	had some kind
	of inbuilt
	Language Acquisition
	Device (LAD). A
	LAD would
	contain a
	set of
	linguistic universals,
	presumed to be
	innate and
	genetically transmitted.
	These universals
	would not<sup>1</sup><sup>
	</sup>however,
	precisely specify
	a particular
	potential language,
	as in
	the; theory described
	at the
	end of
	the last
	chapter; rather,
	they would
	de\-fine somewhat
	narrowly the
	limits on
	the forms
	which human
	language might take,
	thereby drastically
	reducing the
	number of
	hypotheses
	


	

	
	


	that the
	child could
	make about
	the structure
	of his 
	future  native
	tongue and
	rendering it
	correspondingly easy
	for him
	to select 
	the correct  hypothesis.
	


	Since it
	is well
	known that
	children, whatever
	else they
	may do, do
	not in
	fact instantly
	and unerringly
	make correct hypotheses
	about adult structures,
	 but 
	rather  approximate
	 to 
	those  structures
	by  means of
	a fairly
	regular and
	well-defined series
	of stages,
	the innocent
	ob\-server might
	have expected
	the next 
	step to
	consist  of
	an examination of
	the  initial 
	(and  often 
	incorrect)  &quot;hypotheses&quot;
	 made 
	by  the 
	child, to determine
	why it
	was  that 
	that  particular 
	hypothesis,  rather
	 than any
	other, was
	originally  selected.
	 Further 
	steps  might  
	have  con\-sisted
	of  determining 
	in  what 
	ways  the 
	child  discovered 
	the  falsity of
	his original
	hypothesis and
	how he
	subsequently modified
	it (or selected
	an alternative)
	in order
	to approximate
	more closely
	to the linguistic
	models available
	to him.
	


	Unfortunately, nothing
	of  the 
	kind  was 
	done. The 
	founders of generative
	theory remained
	grandly aloof
	from the
	hare they
	had started, claiming
	that real-world
	acquisition processes
	were still
	too chaotic and
	ill
	understood
	to constitute
	a legitimate
	object of
	study and taking
	refuge in
	the &quot;idealization
	of instantaneity&quot;
	described in
	Chomsky and
	Halle (1968:Chapter
	7). Workers
	in t1'e
	field were
	not simply
	left to
	their own
	devices; they
	were continually
	harassed by
	endless revisions
	of the
	theory. Doing
	acquisition work
	along Chom&shy;
	skyan lines
	became  rather
	like playing 
	a game     
	which	few
	minutes the
	umpires revise
	the rules.
	


	Bearing this
	in mind-and
	 bearing 
	in  mind 
	too  that
	workers in
	the field
	not only
	had no
	training in
	the analysis
	of variability
	and dynamic process
	generally  but 
	also  had 
	been  given 
	no  reason 
	even to think
	that such
	training might
	be  necessary-
	it  is
	not surprising
	that their results
	were somewhat
	unrevealing. In
	general, as
	shown, for
	example,  in  
	Brown   and 
	Hanlon  (1970),
	 Brown 
	(1973), 
	Bowerman (
	1973), etc.,
	the predictions
	that generative
	theory seemed 
	to  make about 
	acquisition  were 
	simply  not
	borne  out:
	young  children 
	did not

	rules;  syntactic 
	structures  were 
	not  acquired 
	in  the 
	order  that 
	was dictated by
	their relative
	complexity, and
	so on.
	


	At the
	same time,
	and inspired
	at least
	in part
	by the
	meager results of
	generative-oriented work,
	many scholars
	began  to
	question the assumptions
	on which
	this work
	was based.
	Was the
	input really
	degenerate? Was
	learning as
	rapid as
	had been
	claimed? Did
	it take place
	in  the 
	cognitive  vacuum 
	that  at
	least  seemed 
	to  be 
	implied, if not
	actually asserted,
	in most
	generative writing?
	Upon examination,
	a number
	of these
	assumptions appeared
	to he
	partly or
	even wholly
	incorrect. Thus,
	there came
	about in
	the early
	seventies a
	very rapid and
	extreme swing
	of the
	pendulum, leading
	to  an all
	but universal
	consensus among
	those working
	directly on
	acquisition which
	persists, with relatively
	minor variations,
	up to
	the present.
	


	This consensus,
	while not 
	ruling  out 
	entirely  the 
	possibility that some
	kinds of
	innate mechanisms
	may be
	involved in
	acquisition,
	systematically plays
	down and
	degrades the
	role of
	such mechanisms,
	often regarding 
	them  as
	constituting
	no more
	than a
	&quot;predisposition&quot;
	to acquire
	language, whatever
	that might 
	mean  (they
	never  do
	say). The  consensus
	 holds, 
	however,   that  
	prelinguistic  
	communication and
	extralinguistic knowledge
	(acquired, nat
	urally, through
	experience) play
	crucially important
	roles in
	acquisition, hut
	that perhaps
	the most critical
	role of
	all is
	that of
	the interaction,
	paralinguistic as
	well as
	linguistic, which
	takes place
	between the
	child  and 
	the  mother  (or
	other caregiver).
	The mother,
	it
	is claimed,
	models language
	for the child,
	adapting her
	outputs
	to his
	linguistic level
	at every
	stage. Far
	from being
	degenerate, the
	data she
	provides are
	highly preadapted,
	highly contextualized,
	and patiently
	repeated. &quot;Mothers
	{\itshape teach
	}their children
	to speak,&quot;
	Bruner (1979)
	states. When
	all these
	factors are
	taken fully
	into account,
	the consensus 
	claims, the
	need to
	posit an innate
	component in
	language acquisition
	shrinks to
	near zero
	or even disappears
	altogether.
	


	Unfortunately,  the
	whole
	position  of
	this consensus
	is based 
	on a
	fallacy-a
	fallacy that
	should be
	readily apparent
	to all
	readers of
	the two
	previous chapters.
	That fallacy
	is
	perhaps most
	concisely expressed

	by Sow
	(197
	:367)
	when she
	remarks that
	&quot;Chomsky's
	position regard.mg
	the, unimportance
	of the
	linguistic input
	was unproven,
	since {\itshape all

	{\itshape also

	and
	redundant
	 corpus&quot;
	}(emphasis
	added). This
	1s
	quite sunply
	untrue. The
	input that
	the first
	creole g.eneration
	in Hawaii
	received was
	over-simplified rather
	than simpli&shy;
	fied, and
	was as
	far from
	beiug well
	formed as anyone
	could imagine
	;
	


	and we
	can assume
	that in
	other areas
	where creoles
	formed the
	same state of
	affairs must
	have existed.
	Mother could
	not teach
	{\itshape ;hese
	}chil&shy;
	


	d:en
	to speak,
	for the
	simple and
	inescapable reason
	that Mother
	herself di not
	know the
	language-the language
	didn't exist
	yet. But
	even so,
	without Mother,
	those children
	learned how to
	speak.
	


	In adition
	to:his
	fallacy of
	fact, the
	Bruner-Snow position
	is base on
	a sunple
	log1cal
	fallacy. If
	we accept
	that in
	the vast
	majority of
	ci.rcumstances  mothers
	do teach 
	and  children 
	do learn,
	it by
	no means. follows
	that children
	learn BECAUSE
	mothers teach.
	It would be
	logically quite
	possible to
	argue that
	there is
	no
	connection whatso&shy;
	ever btween
	mothers' teaching
	and children's
	learning, any
	more than
	there is
	between ,children'
	 walking
	and uncles'
	dragging them
	around the
	room by
	thetr fmgert1ps.
	If it
	could be
	shown that
	without well&shy;
	formed  input 
	from  the 
	mother  the 
	child  could 
	not learn
	to speak then
	we might 
	indeed assume
	a causal
	connection. fn
	fact, we
	hav; sown 
	the  reverse: 
	well-formed  input
	 from 
	the mother
	cannot con&shy;
	


	stitute eve
	a necessary
	condition  for
	children  to
	acquire language;
	for, otherwise,
	creoles could not
	exist.
	


	. Bu
	our argument,
	though logically
	correct, need
	not be
	pushed {\itshape t
	}its
	logical extreme.
	I am
	perfectly willing
	to accept
	that if
	mother did not
	teach her
	child English.
	that child
	might have
	a much
	harder tune learning
	it-even
	that the
	child might
	never acquire
	a perfected
	form of
	the language,
	but might
	significantly distort
	it in
	the
	direction of ,the.
	kind d
	pattern we
	reviewed in
	the last
	chapter. All
	I want
	to chum is
	that 1f
	we persist
	in believing
	that the
	child must
	have input m
	order to
	learn,  we 
	shall  continue 
	to  misunderstand 
	completely the way
	in
	which he
	does learn
	a developed,
	natural language.

	the child
	does not
	need mother
	in order
	to learn,
	so he
	could not
	learn even with
	a myriad
	of mothers
	if
	he did
	not have
	the genetic
	program that alone
	enables him
	to take
	advantage of
	her teaching.
	


	In fact,
	the evidence
	we reviewed
	in
	the first
	two chapters
	of this book
	has simply
	never been
	taken  into 
	account  in 
	studies  of child
	language acquisition.
	The vast
	majority of
	scholars in
	the f
	eld evince no
	awareness whatsoever
	of the
	existence, let
	alone the
	possible signiÂ£cance, of
	pidgins  and creoles;
	an honorable
	exception is
	Slobin
	(especially Slobin
	 1977).
	Unfort unately,
	the data
	available to
	Slobin at the
	time were
	by no
	means as
	ample as
	those given
	in the
	present volume; moreover,
	he makes
	the common
	mistake of
	supposing Tok
	Pisin to
	be paradigmatic
	of normal
	pidgin-creole
	development.  Still, even
	limited access to
	pidgin-creole data
	is
	better for
	acquisitionists than
	none, and
	in consequence
	we shall
	find the
	work of
	Slobin and his 
	associates  illuminating
	 on 
	a number 
	of  points
	in the
	pages that
	


	follow.
	


	Meanwhile,  in 
	the  absence 
	of  the
	insights provided 
	by creoliza&shy;
	


	tion, the
	current .paradigm
	has provided
	us with much
	information that
	we lacked
	before-on
	the nature

	&quot;ac.quisition
	s.trategy&quot;
	&quot;ha made
	us aware
	of some
	of the 
	ways  by which
	the child
	may possibly
	'get
	into' the
	linguistic system.
	It  has sl.iown
	us the
	importance of
	perceptual mechanisms
	for interpreting
	utterances, and
	how  as
	adult  speakers
	with  full
	lingllistic competence
	we nevertheless
	rely on
	a
	number of
	short cuts
	to understanding
	. .
	. . The
	concept of
	language acquisition
	strategies  has 
	told  us 
	much\-except how
	the child
	acquires language.&quot;
	Bowerman (1979)
	, who
	cites
	this passage
	with approval,
	further points
	out that
	while such
	strategies may enable
	children to
	understand utterances
	 which 
	still lie
	outside their  developing
	grammars, those
	strategies do
	not  and
	indeed cannot, in
	and of
	themselves, assign
	structural descriptions
	to rhese
	novel tterances. Yet
	 children
	must achieve
	this kind
	of structural
	knowledge
	


	1f they
	are subsequently
	to use
	such utterances
	themselves in
	a
	produc\-tive
	and creative
	way-understanding
	something is
	miles awav
	from manipulating that
	something freely
	and voluntarily.
	fn
	other
	,words,
	strategies belong
	in the
	realm of 
	performance,  and 
	the  problem 
	is, how do
	you get 
	from performance 
	to competence?
	 Small
	wonder that
	so many
	supporters of
	the current
	consensus seek
	to downgtade,
	ignore,
	


	or even
	abolish the
	competence-performance
	distinction. But
	real problems cannot
	be defmed
	away.
	


	.        I
	propose, therefore,
	to review
	the literature
	on acquisition
	as


	


	Hymes's concept 
	of &quot;commumâ¢catiâ¢ve
	competence H;
	on
	


	;'acqm5â¢

	certain  core

	semantic structures,

	strategies&quot; based
	on contextualization,
	semantic and
	pragmatic  clues
	to the
	function of
	novel structures,
	etc., etc.-and
	yet, as
	more and
	more thoughtful
	scholars are
	realizing, the
	gathering of
	this information
	has merely
	served to
	conceal the
	fact that
	the central
	question of
	acquisition, the
	question with
	which the
	early generativists
	did at
	least struggle, however
	unsuccessfully, is
	simply not
	being answered:
	


	

	
	


	How can
	the child
	acquire syntactic
	and semantic
	patterns of great
	arbitrariness and
	complexity in
	such a
	way that they 
	can  be 
	used  creatively 
	without  making 
	mistakes?
	


	

	
	


	Cromer  {1976:353),
	 for
	inst:.mce,
	 observes 
	that  the 
	concept of
	


	some that
	we have
	had occasion
	to deal
	with in
	earlier chapters,
	to see whether
	what we know 
	of the 
	acquisition  process
	supports or
	fails to support
	the hypotheses
	adva11ced
	at the
	end of
	the last
	chapter. To
	the extent
	that these
	hypotheses are
	supported, the
	general theory of
	a human
	language bioprogram
	will tend
	to be
	confirmed. To
	the
	


	Â·extent that
	these hypotheses
	fail to
	be supported,
	doubts will
	be cast upon
	the theory,
	although the 
	reader  should 
	perhaps  be 
	reminded that not
	even the
	most thorough
	refutation, in
	the arena
	of child language,
	 would  make
	the initial
	problem which
	led to
	the theory&shy;
	


	the fact
	that  creoles
	are learned
	without
	experience-miraculously
	&quot;'O

	away.  At 
	worst,   such  refutation
	 would 
	merely  drive 
	us  back 
	to  a
	


	reconsideration of
	that problem.

	But before
	commencing this
	review, three
	words of
	caution are in
	order: the
	first concerning
	the data;
	the second
	concerning the
	reviewer; the
	third concerning
	the theory.
	


	From our
	point of
	view, the
	data suffers
	from two
	defects. First,
	


	much of
	it has
	been presorted
	in ways
	that automatically
	diminish its
	utility. There
	are a variety
	of reasons
	for this,
	but I
	shall deal
	with oly
	one in
	detail, since
	it is
	fairly typical.
	A.round 1970,
	when acqu:si&shy;
	tionists were
	still concerned
	with proving
	(or disproving)
	generative predictions
	about acquisition,
	it
	appeared that
	one way
	of doing
	this would
	be to
	see whether
	features of
	a language
	were acquired
	in an order
	which conformed
	to some
	kind of
	hierarchy
	of grammatical
	complexity-simplest
	first, most
	complex later
	on. But 
	In order 
	to do
	this, it
	was necessary
	to determine
	exactly what
	one me;uit
	by &quot;acquisition
	of a
	feature.&quot;
	Children are
	such messy
	creatues;
	mste.ad
	of quietly
	going to
	bed one
	night without
	a feature,
	and waking   
	;'1th
	it, as
	the Chomskyan
	idealization of
	&quot;instantaneus
	acqu1S1tion&quot; suggests
	they should,
	they stubbornly
	insist on
	alternatmg p:esence
	and absence
	of that
	feature in
	appropriate contexts,
	not to
	mention absence
	and presence
	of that
	feature in
	inappropriate contexts,
	for periods
	of weeks, months,
	and occasionally
	even years.
	


	Not  only 
	that,  but 
	the  little
	beasts  do 
	not .even
	 p_roed.
	as
	


	reason dictates
	they should,
	gradually and
	cumulatively drmmishmg
	inappropriate  usages  as
	they increase
	appropriate ones;
	on the
	contary, a
	graph of
	their appropriate
	productions zigzags
	up and
	down like
	a malaria victim's
	temperature chart,
	before finally
	leveling off
	at or
	near the 
	100 percent 
	mark.  The 
	innocent  observer
	 might 
	think  that 
	the
	


	most interesting
	thing you
	could do
	in acquisition
	study would
	be . to
	figure out
	{\itshape why
	}this
	happens, but
	as usual,
	he would	e
	disappointed. Fashion and
	expediency dictate
	that order
	must be
	imposed on
	dts\-order: to
	determine the
	order of
	acquisition-a
	&quot;need&quot;
	dictated
	merely by
	current theory-Brown
	(1973)
	established a
	.purely :1'bitrary
	&quot;.cri&shy;
	terion&quot; for
	acquisition, i.e.,
	a 90
	percent production
	rate m
	appropriate environments,
	maintained over
	three consecutive
	recording sessions.
	The reign
	of the
	criterion mere
	{ reinforced
	what has
	always been
	


	ACQUISITION<sub>	143</sub>
	


	a trend
	in acquisition
	studies, and
	a deplorable
	oneÂ·<sub>â¢</sub><sub>
	</sub>to
	look to
	the o<sub>0</sub>-oal
	rather than 
	the path, 
	to ask
	&quot;What has
	the child
	acquired?&quot; rather
	than
	


	&quot;How has
	he acquired
	it?&quot; In
	consequence,
	masses of 
	potentially valuable data,
	which would
	be required
	by any
	interesting acquisition
	theory, were
	simply  flushed
	down the
	drain.l
	


	In addition
	to deficiencies
	of this
	nature, we
	have to
	remember that all
	the data
	collected to
	date were
	collected for
	very different
	purposes than
	the present
	one. It
	is
	a general
	law applicable
	to all research
	that one
	tends to
	find what
	 one is
	looking for,
	and not
	to fmd what
	one is
	not looking
	for. Hence,
	it would
	be unrealistic
	if we expected
	to find
	massive quantities
	of unambiguous
	evidence pointing
	toward the
	truth of
	our theory,
	which had
	yet somehow
	been missed by
	previous observers.
	The  most that
	one can
	ever hope
	for from data
	collected under
	other assumptions
	and for
	other purposes
	than one's
	own are
	oblique hints,
	gaps that
	one's own
	hypotheses might
	fill, puzzles
	set aside
	that might
	begin to
	make sense
	in the
	context of
	a different framework.
	However, if
	one finds
	any of
	these at
	all, it
	is a reasonable
	assumption that
	a purposeful
	search of
	raw data
	sources would reveal
	much more-something
	comparable to
	the invisible
	eight-ninths of
	the iceberg.
	


	With regard
	to  the 
	second  word 
	of  caution, 
	I  can 
	lay  claim
	to no
	special expertise
	in
	the field
	of  child 
	language.  In 
	creoles, I have
	fourteen years'
	experience, most
	of them
	spent in
	direct contact
	with native
	creole speakers,
	so that
	I can
	speak in
	that field
	with some degree 
	of  confidence. 
	In  language 
	acquisition,  I
	can claim
	 to be
	no
	


	' more
	than an
	assiduous reader
	of the 
	literature,  and
	in consequence,
	both. my 
	knowledge  and 
	my  understanding 
	may  be
	
	at  fault 
	some&shy;
	


	:mies. On 
	the  credit 
	side,  l 
	can only 
	offer  complete 
	uninvolvement m any
	of the
	controversies that
	have racked
	the field
	(for, as
	we shall see,
	my position,
	although innatist,
	is really
	no closer
	to the
	orthodox Chomskyan one
	than it
	is to
	the &quot;motherese&quot;
	school), and
	the freshness
	


	of perspective
	that a
	novel viewpoint
	may on
	occasion bring.
	So be
	it: the facts
	will decide.
	


	Finally, a
	word of
	caution about
	the theory.

	of
	
	innatist
	
	theories
	
	abound,
	
	and
	
	in
	particular,
	
	those
	
	which
	
	claim
	
	that
	to
	stress
	the
	function
	of
	an
	innate
	component
	in
	acquisition
	is
	auto&shy;
	matically
	equivalent
	to
	completely
	writing
	off
	
	all
	
	other
	
	modes
	
	of
	learning
	and
	all
	other
	aids
	to
	learning.
	In
	the
	present
	case,
	
	this
	
	par&shy;
	ticular
	straw
	man
	has
	even
	less
	substance
	than
	usual.
	The
	language
	bioprogram
	theory
	is,
	as
	we
	shall
	see
	in
	Chapter
	
	4,
	
	an
	
	evolutionary
	theory,
	and
	the
	bioprogram
	itself
	is
	an
	adaptive
	
	evolutionary
	
	device.
	Now,
	it
	is
	the
	nature
	of
	such
	devices
	that
	they
	are
	facilitatory
	,
	not
	pre-emptive;
	that
	is
	to
	say
	,
	
	their
	
	whole
	
	adaptive
	
	function
	
	is
	
	lost
	
	if
	they
	force
	a
	species
	into
	
	a
	 position 
	where
	
	that
	
	species
	
	is
	
	dependent
	upon
	them
	and
	upon
	them
	alone,
	by
	inhibiting
	the
	action
	of
	
	other
	adaptive
	processes.
	
	In
	
	addition
	
	to
	
	whatever
	
	we
	
	may
	
	have
	
	in
	the
	way
	of
	innate
	language
	equipment,
	we
	also
	have
	a
	wide
	 variety
	of
	learning
	strategies
	
	and
	
	problem-solving
	
	routines
	
	which
	
	are
	
	applicable
	
	to
	
	a
	range
	of
	situations
	far
	broader
	than
	language.
	It
	would
	be
	absurd
	to
	suppose
	that
	in
	the
	presence
	of
	data
	classified
	as
	&quot;linguistic,&quot;
	all
	these
	routines
	and
	strategies
	should
	simply
	switch
	off.
	


	It
	would
	be
	equally
	absurd
	to
	suppose
	that
	they
	and
	the
	innate
	language
	component
	would
	be
	always
	and
	necessarily
	at
	war
	with
	one
	another.
	Sometimes
	their
	respective
	promptings
	may
	combine,
	some&shy;
	times
	they
	may
	point
	in
	opposite
	directions;
	which
	way
	is
	an
	empirical
	issue
	at
	anY
	given
	point.
	But
	their
	interaction
	must
	form
	the
	core
	of
	any
	complete
	description
	of
	language
	acquisition.
	If
	Ihave
	ignored
	


	other
	resources
	in
	the
	present
	study
	,
	and
	have
	concentrated
	solely
	on
	the
	innate
	component,
	that
	is
	for
	strategic
	purposes
	only;
	besides,
	general
	cognitive
	processes
	have
	had
	far
	more
	than
	equal
	time
	in
	the
	last
	decade,
	and
	the
	turn
	of
	hardcore
	syntax
	and
	semantics
	has
	come
	around
	again.
	But
	Ibelieve
	that
	in
	order
	to
	acquire
	
	language-a
	
	feat
	which
	is,
	so
	far
	as
	we
	yet
	know,
	without

	in
	the

	we
	need
	every
	ounce
	of
	help,
	particular
	or
	general,
	innate
	or
	acquired
	through
	experience,
	that
	we
	can
	get.
	To
	pit
	one
	kind
	against
	another
	simply
	demonstrates
	a
	failure
	to
	understand
	how

	ACQUISITION<sub>	</sub><sub>1</sub><sub>45</sub>
	


	&quot;.&quot;'ith
	these
	preliminaries
	disposed
	of,
	we
	can
	begin
	our
	review.
	The
	eVJdence
	we
	shall
	consider
	will
	fall
	into
	two
	quite
	separate
	classes.
	One
	class
	will
	consist
	of
	the
	&quot;incorrect
	hypotheses&quot;
	which,
	in
	the
	course
	of
	language
	acquisition,
	children
	often
	make,
	yet
	which
	often
	seem
	t
	have
	o
	simpfo
	explanation
	either
	in
	the
	structure
	of
	the
	input
	th
	child
	receives
	or
	m
	any
	general
	theory
	of
	acquisition.
	The
	simi&shy;
	lanty
	between
	such
	&quot;hypotheses&quot;
	and
	the
	structures
	which
	actually
	em_ege
	as
	part
	of
	the
	grammars
	of
	creole
	languages
	is
	often
	quite
	smk1:1g,
	and
	when
	I
	first
	contemplated
	writing
	this
	chapter,
	Ifelt
	certain
	
	that
	examples
	drawn
	from
	this
	class
	would
	constitute
	by
	far
	


	the
	strongest
	evidence
	in
	favor
	of
	the
	bioprogram
	theory.
	After
	writing
	


	the
	first
	draft
	of
	this
	chapter,
	however,
	I
	became
	much
	less
	certain,
	not
	so
	much
	because
	of
	the
	weakness
	of
	the
	original
	evidence-although
	there
	are.
	some
	phenomena,
	as
	Ishall
	show,
	which
	may
	allow
	alternative
	explanations-but
	because
	of
	the
	growing
	impression
	that
	a
	much
	subtler
	and
	less
	obvious
	class
	of
	evidence
	made
	on
	me.
	


	.	As
	the
	&quot;icorret
	hypotheses&quot;
	suggested,
	there
	were
	many
	things
	m
	language
	.which
	
	children
	
	seemed
	to
	
	find
	quite
	
	difficult
	
	to
	learn,
	often
	spendmg
	years
	before
	they
	acquired
	full
	control
	over
	the
	struc.
	tuts
	concerned.	n
	the
	other
	hand,
	there
	were
	certain
	other
	things
	wluch.
	seemed
	to
	.g
	e
	diem
	no
	trouble
	at
	all,
	which
	they
	learned
	very
	early
	m
	the
	acqmsmon
	process
	and/or
	without
	any
	of
	the
	&quot;mistakes&quot;
	which
	
	arose
	
	so
	
	frequently
	
	in
	
	other
	
	areas.
	On
	principle,
	
	one
	
	might
	suppose
	that
	these
	differences
	correlated
	with
	some
	kind
	of
	scale
	of
	relative
	
	difficulty,
	
	and
	 yet  it
	was
	extremely
	difficult
	to
	see
	exactlv
	what
	
	objective
	factors
	might
	constitute
	such
	a
	scale.
	Indeed,
	from
	commonsense
	linguistic
	viewpoint,
	some
	of
	the
	things
	that
	were
	easily
	and
	effortlessly
	acquired
	looked
	a
	lot
	more
	difficult
	to
	learn
	than
	some
	of
	the
	things
	that
	gave
	so
	much
	trouble.
	


	But
	
	obviously,
	
	to
	
	talk
	
	about
	
	things
	being
	&quot;difficult&quot;
	or
	&quot;easy&quot;
	from
	an
	adult
	standpoint
	is
	totally
	irrelevant
	in
	an
	acquisition
	context.
	What
	
	is
	
	&quot;difficult&quot;
	
	or
	
	&quot;easy&quot;
	for
	the
	child
	is
	all
	
	that
	
	is
	of
	interest
	and
	
	one
	might
	
	therefore
	
	conclude
	
	that
	what
	
	seems
	&quot;difficult&quot;
	to
	u;
	might
	seem
	&quot;easy&quot;
	to
	the
	child,
	and
	vice
	versa.
	However,

	thought should 
	show  that 
	it  was 
	not  so 
	much  the
	adult viewpoint as
	the use of
	the words
	&quot;easy&quot;
	and &quot;difficult&quot;
	themselves that
	was at fault
	in our
	original formulation.
	


	Terms  like 
	&quot;easy&quot; 
	and  &quot;difficult&quot;
	 imply 
	an  act 
	of  evaluation
	


	which in
	t urn
	depends on
	the capacity
	to compare
	one task
	with another, which
	in turn
	depends on
	prior experience
	of tasks
	with differing levels
	of difficulty.
	Thus, when
	we acquire
	a second
	language, we can
	say that
	its derivational
	morphology, for
	example, is
	difficult to learn,
	while its
	relativization processes,
	say, are
	relatively  easy.
	Such remarks
	are meaningful
	only because
	we already
	know a
	language and can
	measure features
	of the
	second language
	against those
	of the first.
	If we
	had not
	previously learned
	a language,
	we would
	have no standard
	of comparison;
	moreover, it
	is at
	least in
	part the
	nature of what
	we have
	already learned
	that determines
	whether what
	we are
	now about to
	learn will
	turn out
	easy or
	difficult for
	us.
	


	Now,  if 
	we  say 
	that  something 
	is easy 
	for  a
	two-year-old  to
	


	learn, we
	cannot possibly
	mean  any 
	of  this; 
	all  we 
	can  mean 
	is that the
	child is
	somehow preadapted
	to learn
	that thing,
	rather than other
	things, or
	that in
	terms of
	the present
	theory ,
	he is
	programmed to learn
	it. If,
	as we
	shall see
	is the
	case, the
	things that
	children learn
	early, effortlessly,
	and errorlessly
	turn out
	repeatedly to
	be key
	features of creole
	languages, which
	the children
	of first
	creole generations
	acquire in
	the absence
	of direct
	experience, we
	can then
	assume that such
	early, effortless,
	and errorless
	learning results,
	not from
	charac\-teristics of
	the input,
	or from
	the efforts
	of the
	mother-since 
	the features
	involved are
	often too
	abstract to
	be known
	to any
	but the
	professional linguist-but
	rather from
	the functioning
	of the
	innate bioprogram
	which we
	have hypothesized.
	


	I find
	evidence of
	this second
	class to
	be even
	more convincing
	


	than that
	drawn from
	systematic error,
	and will
	accordingly begin
	by considering some
	examples of 
	it.  The 
	first  concerns 
	the  learning 
	of the
	specific-nonspecific
	distinction (henceforth
	SNSD) by
	English\-speaking
	children.  This 
	distinction,  as 
	we  saw 
	in  Chapters 
	1 and 
	2, is  explicitly 
	 represented  
	in   all 
	creole   grammars 
	 by  
	the  opposition

	between  zero 
	and  realized 
	determiners. It
	is expressed
	in English  too,
	but much
	more obliquely,
	as we will
	see.
	


	The most
	comprehensive study
	of the
	acquisition of
	English articles is
	that of
	Maratsos (1974,
	1976),
	who confirmed
	by means
	of ingenious experiments
	the naturalistic
	observations of
	Brown (
	1973),
	i.e., that
	the article
	system is
	mastered at
	a very
	early age.
	Some of Maratsos'
	findings have
	been questioned
	in subsequent
	work (Warden 1976,
	Karmiloff-Smith 1979),
	but such
	criticisms relate
	only to
	the earliness with
	which the
	definite-nondefinite
	distinction is
	acquired. No one
	Â·has challenged
	Maratsos' finding
	that the
	SNSD is
	handled virtually
	without error
	by  three-year-olds, well
	ahead of
	the earliest date
	by which
	the child masters
	the definite-nondefinite
	distinction.
	


	At  first 
	sight,  this 
	is  an 
	odd  finding
	since the
	latter distinction
	is clearly
	marked in
	English, while
	the SNSD
	is not.
	In
	English, &quot;definite&quot; 
	really  means  
	presumed   known  
	to   the 
	listener,  whether
	by prior
	knowledge  {\itshape (
	&quot;the
	}man 
	you  met 
	yesterday&quot;), 
	uniqueness  in the
	universe {\itshape (
	&quot;the
	}sun is
	setting&quot;) ,
	uniqueness in
	a given
	setting {\itshape (
	&quot;the
	}battery  is
	 dead&quot;-cars 
	do  not  
	usually   have 
	more  than 
	one  battery),
	or general
	knowledge that 
	a named 
	class exists
	{\itshape (&quot;the
	}dog is
	the friend of
	man&quot;). &quot;Indefinite&quot;
	really means
	presumed unknown
	to the
	listener, whether by
	absence of
	prior  knowledge 
	(&quot;a
	man  you 
	should meet  is
	Mr.  Blank&quot;),
	nonexistence  of
	a nameable 
	referent  (&quot;Bill
	is looking
	for {\itshape a
	}wife&quot;),
	or nonexistence
	of any
	referent (&quot;George
	couldn't see
	{\itshape an
	}aardvark
	anywhere&quot;). In
	other words,
	the two
	classes are
	systematically distinguished
	by the
	distribution of
	{\itshape the
	}and
	{\itshape a/an.}
	


	Specific and
	nonspecific, however,
	are not
	systematically dis&shy;
	tinguished. Consider
	the following:
	


	

	
	


	/1/	If

	you
	should

	the only

	is in

	Maratsos constructed
	an ingenious
	set of
	stories which
	his child subjects
	were asked
	to complete.
	In
	some of
	the stories,
	reference was
	made to a
	specific entity;
	in others,
	to a nonspecific
	entity; in
	both cases,
	naturally, the
	entity was
	introduced into
	the story
	as {\itshape a
	NP.
	}However,
	the completion
	task required
	the child
	to produce 
	{\itshape a
	NP
	}just 
	in case the
	entity was
	nonspecific, and
	{\itshape the
	NP
	}just in
	case the
	entity was
	specific, in
	accordance with
	the rule
	illustrated in
	/9/
	and /10/
	above (for
	full texts
	of  the stories
	and a
	more complete
	description
	of the
	experiments, see
	Maratsos 1976).
	


	The success
	rate in
	this experiment
	was almost
	90 percent
	for three-vear-olds and
	over 90
	percent for
	four-year-olds. In
	order to maintin
	these high
	rates, the
	children had 
	to  determine 
	that  out
	of some
	NPs identically
	marked, half 
	had  specific
	real-world  referents
	and half
	had not.
	The stories
	were original
	and contained
	no contextual
	clues as
	to
	the status
	of the
	referents.  How 
	did the
	children succeed
	so often?
	


	Maratsos himself
	was surprised
	and impressed
	by his
	subjects' capacities, 
	and  he

	differences  in 
	the  circumstances
	 of 
	their use that
	correspond to
	the specific-nonspecific
	distinction. One
	clear requirement is
	that  he
	 have 
	available  some 
	conceptual  understanding
	of such matters 
	as the 
	difference between
	 the
	notion  of
	any member (or
	no member)
	of a
	class and
	that of
	a particular
	class member.
	This understanding must
	be sufficiently
	well articulated
	for the
	child to perceive
	just this
	difference in
	the circumstances
	of use
	of the
	definite and indefinite
	morphemes and
	construct the
	meaning of
	the terms
	accordingly&quot; (Maratsos
	 1974:453).
	


	Let us
	try to
	reconstruct the
	process or
	processes by
	which the child
	might arrive
	at this 
	perception.  We 
	will
	ignore  the
	 problems that
	arise from
	the child's
	original isolation and
	recognition of
	articles, although
	these are
	far from
	trivial (especially
	with {\itshape a,
	}so frequently
	reduced to
	an unstressed 
	schwa and
	so closely
	linked to
	its following NP 
	that  morpheme 
	boundary  perception
	 becomes  
	quite   difficult),
	and deal
	solely with
	how, having
	recognized  them, 
	he  determines
	their functions.
	If
	the 
	conventional  accounts
	 are 
	correct,  the 
	child can do
	this in
	only two
	ways-through linguistic
	context or
	through extralinguistic 
	context.
	


	The nature
	of the
	problems involved
	can be
	better understood
	if we
	compare the
	acquisition of
	articles with
	the acquisition
	of plural marking,
	which occurs
	at roughly
	the same
	age (a
	very few
	weeks later,
	according to
	Brown 1973).
	The plural
	morpheme marks
	a single,
	straightforward
	distinction-one/more than
	one-and it
	does so  bi&shy;
	uniquely, that
	is to
	say, in
	a one-morpheme,
	one-meaning relationship: when
	the morpheme
	is present,
	one meaning
	is entailed;
	when it
	is
	absent, the
	other meaning
	is entailed.
	Articles are,
	from a
	purely formal
	viewpoint, much
	more complex
	than that.

	{\itshape the,

	zero, represent
	two
	distinctions-supposed-known-to-listener
	{\itshape I
	}sup&shy;
	posed-unknown-to-listener
	and specific-referent
	{\itshape I
	}no-specific-referent\-but
	without the
	biuniqueness that
	relates semantics
	to surface
	repre\-sentation in
	the c'ase
	of plurals.
	Instead, with
	regard to
	the second
	distinction only
	(the SNSD),
	there are
	two morphemes
	with one meaning
	(both {\itshape a
	}and {\itshape the
	}can have
	specific reference)
	and one
	mor\-pheme with
	two meanings
	{\itshape (a
	}can be
	both specific
	and nonspecific).
	


	Let us
	suppose that
	the child
	can first
	factor out
	the distinction
	between {\itshape o,
	}and {\itshape the
	}(although in
	fact he
	cannot even
	rely on
	this  aid; Warden 
	[1976] 
	and  Karmiloff-Smith
	 [1979]
	 show  that 
	it  will 
	be several
	years  before 
	he  is
	able  to 
	overcome  this 
	potential  distraction).
	He then
	has  to 
	distinguish  specific
	 from 
	nonspecific  {\itshape a.
	
	}One  might
	think he
	could do
	this by
	distinguishing between
	 linguistic 
	environ\-ments. For
	instance,  the 
	scope of 
	negation  is
	often  crucial
	in determin&shy;
	ing whether
	a given
	occurrence of
	{\itshape a
	NP
	}is specific
	or nonspecific:
	the difference between
	{\itshape I
	saw
	a
	dog
	}(S) and
	{\itshape I
	didn't
	see
	a
	dog
	}(NS), for
	instance.  So
	is the 
	scope  of 
	desiderative  verbs:
	 the 
	difference  between
	{\itshape I
	want
	a
	dog
	}(NS) and
	{\itshape I
	have
	a
	dog
	}(S). Those
	who put
	their  trust in
	extralinguistic context
	will, however,
	point out,
	quite correctly , 
	that things like
	desiderative scope
	and negative
	scope are
	themselves ex&shy;
	tremely  abstract 
	relations,  unlikely
	 to
	be capturable  by 
	two-year-olds.
	


	But in
	fact the
	problem is
	even tougher
	than we
	have suggested;
	there are
	many cases in
	which a
	mere tense
	switch marks
	the SNSD:
	


	

	
	


	/11/    When
	you see
	{\itshape a
	dog
	}(NS) ,
	are you
	frightened?
	


	/12/   When
	you saw
	{\itshape a
	dog
	}(S), were
	you frightened?
	


	

	
	


	Since the
	child's control
	of tense
	is, at
	the appropriate
	age, highly
	questionable at
	best, it
	is implausible
	to suppose
	that he
	could utilize such
	clues.<sup>3</sup><sup>
	</sup>Again, there
	are cases
	when desiderative
	scope alone
	is insufficient
	to mark
	the distinction:
	


	

	
	


	/13/  
	Your little
	sister wants
	{\itshape a
	dog-any
	}kind of
	dog (NS).
	


	/14/
	  Your
	little sister
	wants {\itshape a
	}dog-and
	it's that
	one (S)!
	


	\
	


	ACQUISITION	151
	


	

	
	


	In fact,
	the only
	reliable indicator
	of the
	SNSD is
	not a
	single article
	use, but
	a  series 
	of  articles 
	uses; an
	{\itshape a-a 
	}sequence, as
	in  /10/
	 above,
	as opposed
	to an
	{\itshape a-the
	}sequence, as
	in /9
	/ above.
	


	However, as
	Maratsos (1976:95)
	again points
	out, it
	is at
	least highly
	questionable whether
	the child
	can take
	advantage of
	clues provided by
	sequences, especially
	when members
	of such
	sequences are not
	necessarily adjacent-as
	they are
	in /9
	/ and
	/10/-but
	may be
	separated by
	several sentences:
	 &quot;It
	is easy 
	to forget
	that the
	child, to the
	best of our
	present knowledge,
	does not have
	an extensive
	corpus of data
	at any
	one time
	with which
	to work.
	He probably
	cannot record numerous
	long stretches
	of conversation
	and all
	of the
	con\-textual
	information that
	accompanied them,
	as can
	an adult
	linguist investigating a
	novel language.&quot;
	


	We must
	therefore conclude
	that a
	child would 
	be,  at 
	best, highly unlikely
	to derive
	the SNSD
	from analysis
	of purely
	linguistic context.
	


	Yet  is
	it  any 
	more  likely 
	that  he 
	could  learn 
	it  from 
	physical
	


	experience or
	any other
	kind of
	extralinguistic source?
	As noted
	above, recent studies
	have concentrated
	heavily on
	the here-and-newness
	of speech aimed 
	at  children, 
	and  on 
	the child's
	prelinguistic 
	experiences in the
	world of
	objects. It
	is hard
	to see
	just how
	either of
	these could help
	with the
	SNSD. As
	Maratsos (1976:94)
	remarks, &quot;specific
	and nonspecific reference
	are connected
	in no
	clear way
	with external
	physical attributes
	or relations
	of perceived
	objects.&quot; For
	example, nonspecific
	reference is
	usually (although
	not always)
	made in
	the absence of
	any member
	of  the referent
	class: {\itshape we
	don't
	have
	a
	doggy,
	Daddy's
	looking
	for
	a
	doggy
	for
	you,
	a
	doggy
	would
	be
	nice
	to
	play
	with,
	wouldn't
	it?
	}and so
	on. But
	specific reference
	 is
	made just 
	as often in
	the  absence
	of the
	referent :
	{\itshape a
	dog
	bit
	Jessie
	yesterd
	ay,
	I
	saw
	a
	dog
	you'd
	really
	have
	liked
	in
	town
	today,
	}and so
	on. How
	does the
	child determine
	that of
	the two
	absent sets
	of referents
	one is
	concrete while the
	other is
	only hypothetical?
	If he 
	did  not 
	do  so,
	he would score
	no better
	than chance
	on Maratsos'
	tests.

	While
	it
	is
	true
	that
	many
	concepts
	are
	formed
	by
	the
	child
	prior
	to
	language
	learning,
	these
	are
	generally
	concepts
	which
	relate
	to
	physical
	objects
	which
	the
	child
	can
	see,
	touch,
	etc.
	Moreover,
	it
	is
	reasonably
	clear
	that
	such
	concepts
	ARE
	arrived
	at
	by
	interaction
	with
	experience
	rather
	than
	by
	merely
	processing
	language
	input.
	If
	the
	child
	only
	processed
	linguistic
	tokens
	of
	{\itshape dog,
	}for
	example,
	he
	would
	pre&shy;
	sumably
	apply
	the
	term
	only
	to
	members
	of
	the
	appropriate
	species;
	whereas,
	as
	is
	well
	known,
	the
	initial
	meaning
	of
	{\itshape dog,
	}for
	the
	child,
	is
	likely
	to
	be
	'any
	four-legged
	mammal'.
	Thus,
	we
	
	know
	
	that
	the
	child
	reaches
	out
	ahead
	of
	linguistic
	experience,
	so
	to
	speak,
	in
	order
	


	to
	derive
	ways
	of
	talking
	about
	the
	world.
	


	

	
	


	But
	how
	
	could
	the
	 child  derive
	knowledge
	of
	purely
	abstract
	relationships
	from
	direct
	experience?
	A
	comparison
	with
	plural-marking
	acquisition
	is
	again
	very
	much
	to
	the
	point.
	Plural
	marking
	is
	directly
	associated
	with
	relations
	that
	the
	child
	is
	physically
	
	able
	to
	observe.
	He
	can
	see
	and
	feel
	at
	any
	given
	time
	whether
	he
	has
	one
	toy
	or
	several,
	whether
	he
	is
	allowed
	only
	one
	cookie
	or
	more
	than
	one
	;
	the
	gramma&shy;
	tical
	marking
	of
	nouns
	correlates
	directly
	with
	manifest
	
	and
	obvious
	differences
	in
	his
	perceptual
	field.
	But
	the
	distinction
	between
	an
	actual
	member
	of
	a
	class
	(which
	more
	often
	than
	not
	is
	not
	physically
	present)
	and
	an
	imaginary
	representative
	of
	that
	same
	class
	is
	in
	no
	way
	one
	that
	Â·
	can
	
	be
	
	determined
	
	by
	
	the
	
	organs
	
	of
	
	perception,
	
	or
	inferred
	
	from
	any
	kind
	
	of
	direct
	experience.
	The
	SNSD
	involves
	comparisons,
	not
	between
	physical
	entities,
	but
	between
	purely
	mental
	representations;
	one
	can
	only
	marvel
	that
	a
	child,
	for
	whom
	the
	boundaries
	between
	.
	real
	
	and
	unreal
	
	are
	notoriously
	vague,
	should
	be
	able
	to
	make
	it
	at
	


	all,
	by
	{\itshape any
	}means.
	


	Indeed,
	that
	he
	
	should
	
	even
	hypothesize
	
	such
	 a
	distinction-a
	would,
	presumably,
	be
	claimed
	by
	those
	who
	believe
	in
	a
	hypothesisâ¢

	hypothesis-testing

	{\itshape the,

	that

	Since
	definites
	tend
	to

	while
	indefinite
	tend
	to
	be
	objects,
	one
	might
	hypothesize
	that
	{\itshape the
	}marks
	agents
	and

	{\itshape a
	}marks
	patients.
	Since
	{\itshape the
	}often
	co-occurs
	with
	NPs
	that
	are
	physically
	present
	and
	{\itshape a
	}with
	NPs
	that
	are

	absent
	one
	might

	pothesize

	}and
	{\itshape a
	}mark
	poles
	of
	some
	kind
	of
	proximal-distal
	distinction.
	In
	fact,
	so
	far
	as
	we
	know,
	such
	hypotheses
	are
	never
	made.
	In
	any
	case,
	they
	would
	affect
	only
	{\itshape a

	{\itshape the;

	to
	{\itshape a

	why
	on

	should
	
	the

	even
	start
	by
	hypothesizing
	
	that
	 there
	are
	really
	two
	
	kinds
	
	of
	{\itshape a?
	
	}Moreover,
	
	since
	two-year-olds
	
	use
	
	few
	or
	no
	articles,
	and
	the
	SNSD
	is
	acquired
	by
	about
	the
	
	age
	 of 
	three,
	
	it
	would
	have
	to
	be
	just
	about
	
	the
	
	first
	
	hypothesis
	
	the
	
	child
	
	makes&shy;
	there
	would
	 hardly
	be
	time
	to
	frame
	and
	discard
	any
	other.
	To
	say
	that
	the
	child
	invariably
	forms
	
	a
	
	correct
	
	hypothesis
	
	about
	
	the
	
	SNSD
	as
	his
	first
	hypothesis
	is
	simply
	an
	issue-dodging
	way
	of
	saying
	that
	he
	is
	programmed
	to
	make
	the
	SNSD.
	


	Indeed,
	we
	can
	only
	conclude
	that
	the
	SNSD
	would
	be
	quite
	impossible
	to
	
	learn,
	
	by
	
	means
	
	of
	
	linguistic
	
	data,
	
	or
	
	of
	
	experience,
	or
	of
	
	any
	 hypothesis-forming 
	process,
	
	or
	of
	any
	feasible
	combination
	of
	these.
	For
	the
	child
	to
	make
	the
	SNSD
	as
	early
	and
	as
	successfully
	as
	he
	does,
	he
	would
	have
	to
	be
	somehow
	preprogrammed
	
	to
	make
	it.
	


	This
	proposal
	
	is
	strongly
	supported
	by
	the
	creole
	data
	reviewed
	in
	Chapters
	1
	and
	2.
	We
	saw
	there
	that
	the
	SNSD
	was
	made
	by
	the
	first
	creole
	generation
	in
	Hawaii
	(even
	though
	none
	of
	their
	HPE-speaking
	parents
	made
	it
	)
	and
	that
	it
	is
	made
	consistently,
	
	and
	always
	by
	the
	same
	means,
	in
	all
	creole
	languages.
	If
	we
	assume
	a
	language
	bioprogram
	that
	
	includes
	
	the
	
	SNSD
	in
	its

	correctly interpreting
	the two
	{\itshape as,
	}do not
	mark, or
	at least
	attempt to mark,
	nonspedfics with
	zero, as
	creole children
	do? The
	answer is
	that we do
	not know
	that they
	do not.
	


	Earlier,  I 
	referred  to 
	deficiencies  in
	the data
	due to
	excessive
	


	concentration on 
	the goals
	rather  than 
	the paths
	of acquisition.
	Here is a case
	in point.
	Even as conscientious
	and insightful
	a scholar
	as Maratsos confesses
	(1974:450) that
	&quot;only full
	noun  phrases 
	of the form
	article plus
	noun were
	counted; answers
	which included
	no article, such
	as {\itshape boy,
	}were not
	counted in
	the analysis.&quot;
	Another careful
	inves\-tigator,
	Brown (1973),
	who  allots some
	sixteen pages
	to a
	discussion of
	articles in
	early child 
	speech, makes
	no reference 
	to zero  forms,
	and in
	what he
	claims is
	a &quot;full
	list of
	errors in
	definite
	and nondefmite
	reference for
	Adam, Eve
	and Sarah
	from Stages
	IV and
	V&quot; (1973:
	Table 51)
	includes only
	cases of
	{\itshape a
	}where  {\itshape the
	}is indicated,
	and cases
	of {\itshape the
	}where {\itshape a
	}is
	indicated-no zeros
	at all.
	Yet from
	what Maratsos
	says, and
	from mere
	common sense,
	one knows
	there {\itshape must
	}have been
	zeros; after
	all, the
	child has
	no articles
	at the
	two-word stage,
	and obviously does
	not acquire
	the surface
	forms overnight.
	


	The present
	theory predicts
	that when
	a substantial 
	body  of early
	child language
	is properly
	examined, there
	will be
	found to
	be a significant
	skewing in
	article placement,
	such that
	a significantly
	higher percentage
	of articles
	will be
	assigned to
	specific-reference NP,
	while zero
	forms will
	persist in
	nonspecific environments
	longer than
	elsewhere. Such examination
	affords a
	simple and
	straightforward means
	of empirically 
	testing  the 
	claims  made 
	about  the 
	innateness of the
	SNSD in
	this chapter.
	


	

	
	


	We will
	now examine
	another distinction
	which is
	made even earlier
	and without
	, apparently,
	even a
	single reported
	case of
	error. This is
	the distinction
	between states
	and processes,
	including under
	the latter
	rubric verbs
	of experiencing
	as well
	as action
	verbs (hereafter
	referred to
	as the
	state-process
	distinction, or
	SPD). The
	SPD is
	di&shy;
	rectly  involved 
	in the
	acquisition  of 
	the  English
	progressive  marker
	


	{\itshape <b>-in</b><b>g.</b>}
	


	\
	


	ACQUISITION<sup>	</sup><sup>155</sup>
	


	

	
	


	In general, 
	the  acquisition 
	of  novel 
	morphology  by 
	the child is
	attended by
	cases of
	over-generalization, a
	number of
	which are
	dis\-cussed in
	Cazden (1968).
	Thus, the
	consistency in
	the final
	segments of
	possessive pronouns
	leads to
	production of
	the aberrant
	form {\itshape *mines,
	}while plurals
	such as
	{\itshape *sheeps,
	*foots
	}(or {\itshape *feets),
	*mouses,
	}etc., and
	past-tense forms
	such as
	{\itshape *corned,
	*goed
	}(or {\itshape *wented),
	*buyed, 
	}etc., occur
	in the
	speech of
	most, if
	not all,
	child learners
	of English.
	


	The {\itshape -ing
	
	}form is
	acquired even
	earlier
	than the
	{\itshape -ed
	}form
	(before
	


	any of the
	other thirteen
	morphemes  studied
	in Brown 
	[1973],
	and as early
	as the
	second year
	in at
	least some
	cases). Also,
	just as
	there are verbs
	that do
	not take
	{\itshape -ed,
	}there are
	verbs that
	do not
	take {\itshape -ing
	}(with certain
	qualifications, see
	Sag 1973),
	such as {\itshape lik
	e,
	want,
	know,
	see,
	}etc. These
	verbs are
	quite common
	in children's
	speech, probably
	as common as
	many of the irregular
	verbs to
	which children
	incor\-rectly attach
	{\itshape -ed.
	}Yet,
	apparently, children
	never ever
	attach {\itshape -ing
	}to stative
	verbs.
	


	Kuczaj (1978)
	has argued
	that the
	two cases
	are not
	really commensurate
	since with
	the past
	tense there
	are other
	ways of
	mark\-ing than
	{\itshape -ed 
	}(just as
	with plurals
	there are
	other ways
	of marking
	than
	


	{\itshape -s),
	}whereas
	in the
	case of
	{\itshape -ing,
	}English has
	no alternative
	way of marking
	progressive aspect.
	This argument
	is somewhat
	disingenuous since zero
	can be
	a term 
	in  a
	subsystem,  and 
	it is
	hard  to 
	see what the
	difference would
	be between,
	on the
	one hand,
	adding {\itshape -s
	}to
	{\itshape sheep }to
	make {\itshape sheeps
	}or {\itshape -ed
	}to {\itshape put
	}to make
	{\itshape putted
	,
	}and, on
	the other
	hand, adding {\itshape -ing
	}to {\itshape like
	}to yield
	{\itshape I
	am
	liking
	you. }A
	more pertinent
	observa\-tion would
	be that
	verbs which
	do not
	take {\itshape -ing,
	}as opposed
	to verbs which
	do not
	take {\itshape -ed
	}or nouns
	which do
	not take
	{\itshape -s,
	}constitute  a
	natural semantic
	class; we shall
	return to
	this point
	in a
	moment.
	


	In fact,
	Kuczaj undercuts
	his own
	argument by
	observing that
	children do
	indeed over-generalize
	{\itshape -ing,
	}but not
	to stative
	verbs\-rather, to
	nonverbal items,
	as in
	/15/:

	}etc. 
	But  all 
	these  verbs 
	have  in 
	common  the fact
	that they
	are nonstatives,
	as {\itshape weather
	
	}would 
	be  also 
	if  it
	were  a
	verb in
	the sense
	of /15/. 
	The  fact 
	that  children 
	will  generalize 
	{\itshape -ing
	}even to
	nouns IF
	AND ONLY
	IF SUCH
	NOUNS HAVE
	A PLAUSIBLE
	


	NONSTATIVE READING
	makes  their 
	abstemiousness  with
	 respect to stative
	verbs even
	more significant.
	


	Brown (1973:326ff.)
	rightly regards
	it as
	remarkable that
	chil\-dren
	should be
	&quot;able
	to learn 
	a concept
	like involuntary
	state before they
	[are] three
	years old,&quot;
	and explores
	several hypotheses
	 which might
	account for
	such learning.
	In the
	case of
	one child,
	Eve, he
	was able to
	show that
	many nonstatives,
	as well
	as statives,
	were unmarked by
	{\itshape -ing,
	}and
	that the
	unmarked nonstatives
	were precisely
	those which Eve's
	mother seldom
	used with
	progressive aspect
	; on
	the other
	hand, the nonstatives
	which the
	mother did
	use frequently
	with {\itshape -ing
	}were precisely 
	those  which 
	appeared  with 
	{\itshape -ing
	
	}in
	Eve's speech.
	However, a similar
	relationship did
	not hold
	for the
	other children
	in Brown's study;
	and as
	Brown himself
	pointed out,
	even if
	it had
	held, it
	would not have
	provided a
	solution.
	For anyone
	who claimed
	that children
	delayed applying
	{\itshape -Ing
	}to a
	verb until
	they learned
	from experience
	that it was
	&quot;-ingable&quot;
	would then
	be forced
	to explain
	why a
	similar caution
	and restraint
	was not
	applied to
	other morphemes,
	like {\itshape -ed
	
	}and {\itshape -s,
	}where
	over-generalizations
	abounded.
	


	Brown next
	considered the
	possibility that
	the SPD
	was learned from
	imperatives and
	transferred to
	progressives, since
	the verbs
	that will not
	take {\itshape -ing
	}are
	just those
	that cannot
	be used
	in
	the
	imperative. Against this
	possibility, Brown
	argued that
	it would
	depend also
	on imperative usage
	being errorless;
	and it
	was simply
	impossible to
	tell whether this
	was the
	case since,
	especially in
	Stage I,
	children's impera&shy;
	tives are
	often formally
	indistinguishable from
	their declaratives
	{\itshape (
	want
	cookie
	}looks
	like an
	imperative, but
	is probably
	no more 
	than  the child's
	version of
	'I want
	a cookie').
	


	A stronger
	argument against
	t)ie &quot;imperative
	transfer&quot; hypothesis,
	


	<sup>ACQUISITION</sup>	157
	


	

	
	


	not made 
	by  Brown,
	involves first
	recognizing that
	Brown's argument
	is in
	error; children
	could learn
	imperatives through
	trial and
	error and, having
	learned at
	last the
	list of
	verbs which
	could not
	be imperatives,
	simply apply
	that knowledge
	to the
	learning of
	{\itshape -ing.
	}But
	trial-and-error learning of
	imperatives is
	more implausible
	than errorless
	learning of
	imperatives, and
	for the
	following  reason:
	 in 
	trial-and-error 
	learning, the child
	must correct
	himself simply
	through observing
	that others
	produce forms
	different from
	his (we
	know that
	overt correction
	of grammar, as
	opposed to
	content, is
	rare  among 
	parents).  Thus, 
	the child who
	says {\itshape drinked
	}eventually
	becomes aware that
	 others 
	say {\itshape drank
	,
	}and
	revises his
	grammar accordingly.
	If such
	things  did
	 not
	come to
	his attention,
	he would
	presumably go
	on saying
	{\itshape drinked
	}indefinitely.
	


	But negative
	evidence cannot
	function in
	this way.
	Let us
	sup\-pose that
	the child
	who said
	{\itshape want
	cookie
	}really
	was urging
	someone else to
	desire a
	cookie. Would
	the fact
	that he
	did NOT
	hear others
	saying
	


	{\itshape *want
	some
	chocolate
	}or
	{\itshape *hate
	naughty
	bunny
	}deter
	him? It
	is hardly likely.
	I know
	of no
	facts which
	would indicate
	that a
	child needs
	positive reinforcement,
	as well
	as an
	absence of
	counterexamples, in
	order to  maintain
	his current
	grammar. The 
	child may
	be diverted from
	that  ammar
	by the
	existence of
	contradictory forms
	to which he
	is obliged
	to pay
	attention; we
	can hardly
	expect him
	to pay
	atten\-tion to
	something that
	is NOT
	happening.
	


	Moreover, on
	a  purely 
	pra,a,matic
	 basis, 
	trial-and-error  learning
	of imperatives
	is unlikely.
	A child's
	early imperatives
	are  all action&shy;
	oriented, aimed
	at getting
	people to
	pick him 
	up  or  put 
	him  down, bring
	nice things
	to him
	and take
	nasty things
	away. It
	would be
	bizarre if
	he sought
	 instead 
	to  influence 
	the  thought-processes
	 and
	emotions of others
	by commanding 
	them  to 
	want,  need, 
	know,  etc. 
	In  fact, the
	likeliest possibility
	is that
	children do
	not acquire
	the  SPD from
	imperatives, either
	errorlessly or by
	trial and
	error, because
	they them&shy;
	selves would
	only ever
	need nonstative
	imperatives for
	pragmatic reasons. They
	would not
	know whether
	statives could
	be used
	as imperatives  because
	 the 
	opportunity   for 
	such  use 
	would  simply 
	not

	have occurred-unless
	of course
	they were
	already programmed
	with the
	SPD, and
	thus  &quot;knew&quot;
	that such
	uses were
	impossible, without
	requiring experience
	to prove
	it.
	


	But whereas
	the use
	of imperative
	statives might 
	seem bizarre, the
	use of
	progressive {\itshape -ing
	}with
	statives would
	surely appear,
	to a
	child not programmed
	with the
	SPD, to
	be the
	most natural
	thing  in 
	the world. For {\itshape -ing
	}is
	applied to
	verbs with
	present reference,
	and when
	a child wants
	or  sees
	or likes
	something, it
	is right
	now that
	he does
	it.
	


	{\itshape *I
	wanting
	teddy
	(now)
	}or
	{\itshape *I
	seeing
	pussy
	(now)
	}would
	surely
	appear,
	to
	such
	a
	child,
	every
	bit
	as
	grammatical
	as
	{\itshape I
	playing
	pee
	kaboo
	(now)
	}or
	{\itshape I
	sitting
	potty
	(now).
	}Nobody
	could
	claim
	that
	the
	distinction
	emerged
	from
	experience,
	or
	from
	context;
	on
	the
	contrary,
	both
	experience
	and
	context
	would
	point
	in
	a
	contrary
	direction.
	


	

	
	


	Finally, Brown
	considered  the
	possibility  that 
	the distinction is
	innately known.
	However, he
	rejects this
	possibility because
	of what he
	claims are
	&quot;fatal
	difficulties.&quot; Since
	neither he
	nor other scholars
	who have
	discussed the
	issue (e.g.,
	Kuczaj 1978,
	Fletcher 1979)
	have advanced
	any serious
	alternative to
	the innatist
	suggestion, we should
	examine Brown's
	&quot;difficulties&quot;-bearing
	in mind
	that they arose
	out of
	a theory
	of innateness
	quite different
	from this
	one-and
	see whether
	they are
	really as
	&quot;fatal&quot; as
	he believes.
	


	The first
	difficulty is
	that, according
	to Brown,
	children do
	not behave as innatist
	theory predicts
	with respect
	to categories
	other than
	state-process. If
	they came
	equipped with
	a full
	set of
	syntactic and/or
	semantic subcategories,
	&quot;they ought
	to attempt
	to order
	regular and
	irregular inflections
	in terms
	of one
	or another
	of the
	innate subcate&shy;
	gories. They
	should  test 
	the hypothesis 
	that  verbs
	that  take 
	{\itshape -d
	
	}[sic]
	in the
	past are
	all transitives
	and the
	others intransitives
	or that
	those that take
	{\itshape -d
	}are  animate
	actions and 
	the  others
	not, or
	something of this 
	kind&quot;  (1973:328).
	 Of 
	course,  this 
	does not  happen,
	and because
	it does
	not happen
	with distinctions
	other than
	the SPD,
	Brown con&shy;
	cludes that
	the SPD
	cannot be
	innate.
	


	Now  this
	argument  makes 
	sense only 
	if  you
	assume, first,
	that
	


	\
	


	ACQUISITION	159
	


	

	
	


	children are
	born with
	all the
	subcategorization
	features of
	an {\itshape Aspects
	}grammar in
	their heads
	(a view
	Brown specifically
	attributes to
	McNeil! [1966]
	), and
	second, that
	children, like
	junior linguists,
	acquire gram&shy;
	mars by
	formulating and
	testing hypotheses.
	The present
	theory  as&shy;
	sumes neither
	of these
	things. Thus, 
	the  fact 
	that  other 
	distinctions were treated
	differently  from the
	SPD could
	never constitute
	an argu\-ment
	against the
	innateness of
	the SPD,
	unless it
	could be
	shown that those
	other distinctions
	also formed
	part  of 
	the  bioprogram. 
	To  do that,
	it would
	be necessary
	to show
	that those
	distinctions were 
	for\-mally marked
	in creole
	languages. In creoles,
	animate actions
	are not formally
	distinguished from
	other types
	of action,
	and transitive
	verbs are not
	formally distinguished
	from intransitive
	verbs-quite the
	reverse, indeed,
	as we
	saw in
	the section
	on Passive
	Equivalents in
	Chapter 2, and
	as we
	shall see
	again later
	in this
	chapter. Thus,
	the child
	hy\-potheses Brown
	suggests would
	not make
	any kind
	of sense
	in light
	of the present
	theory, even
	if that
	theory supposed
	that children
	test hypotheses-which
	 it
	does not.
	


	Brown's second
	difficulty is
	that the
	SPD is
	&quot;a poor
	candidate
	


	for innateness&quot;
	because it
	is &quot;very
	far from
	being universal
	in  the world's
	languages.&quot;
	The problems
	foreign learners
	have with
	English progressives
	and a
	claim by
	Joos (1964)
	that English
	is &quot;unique
	or almost
	unique&quot; in
	possessing the
	SPD are
	adduced as
	evidence for
	this <b>contention.</b>
	


	Again, in
	the  present 
	theory, whether 
	or not 
	a given
	feature is common
	to all the
	world's languages
	is quite
	irrelevant. All
	previous universals
	theories have
	been static
	theories, which
	assume that
	lan\-guage is
	always and
	everywhere the
	same; if
	one accepts
	this, it
	follows that only
	features that
	occur in
	all languages
	can really
	qualify as
	can\-didates for
	innateness. But
	the  present theory
	is a
	dynamic, evolu&shy;
	tionary theory
	which assumes
	that language
	had a
	starting point
	and a sequence of
	developments, which
	are recycled,
	in rather
	different ways,
	inhoth creole
	formation and
	child acquisition,
	as well
	as perhaps
	in certain types
	of linguistic
	change (consideration
	of which
	would take us
	beyond the
	scope of
	the present
	volume). What
	is innate
	is therefore
























	


	<sub>1</sub><sub>60	</sub>ROOTS
	OF
	LANGUAGE
	


	

	
	


	what was
	there at
	the  beginning 
	of  the 
	sequence,  and 
	thus there 
	is not the
	slightest
	reason to suppose
	that innate
	features will
	automati\-cally
	persist and
	be found
	in the
	structure of
	all synchronic
	languages\-indeed,
	given the
	nature of
	dynamic processes,
	this would
	be an ex&shy;
	tremely unlikely
	result.
	


	In other
	words,  the 
	SPD is
	presumed  to be
	innate, not
	because of its
	universality, which
	may well
	be as
	low as
	Brown suggests,
	but because it
	plays a
	crucial role
	in
	creole grammars.
	There, statives
	are distinguished from
	nonstatives by
	the fact
	that the
	nonpunctual marker
	never attaches
	to the
	former ;
	but that is
	by no
	means the
	only signifi&shy;
	cant difference
	between the
	treatment of
	the two
	categories. The
	SPD causes a
	characteristic skewing
	of the
	creole TMA
	system, not
	explicitly treated in
	the present
	volume, but
	discussed at
	some length
	in Bicker\-ton
	(197
	5 :Chapter
	2). Briefly,
	there is
	a significant
	difference between
	creole and 
	ludo-European  systems
	 which 
	takes  the 
	following  form.
	In the
	latter, the
	same morphological
	marking applies
	to both
	statives and
	nonstatives in
	any given
	tense; this
	seems  so
	obvious that 
	it is never
	even remarked
	on. In
	creoles, however,
	present-reference
	statives and present-reference
	11onstatives
	carmot be
	marked in
	the same
	way, and the
	same applies
	to past-reference
	statives and
	nonstatives. The
	pattern for
	GC, which
	we may
	take as
	typical in
	this respect,
	is given in
	Table 3.1
	below:
	


	<sup>ACQUISITION</sup>	161
	


	

	
	


	in creole
	grammar, his 
	second objection
	to the
	innateness of
	the SPD is also
	deprived of
	its force.
	


	However, Brown's
	claim that,
	if
	a distinction
	were genuinely
	


	innate, it
	might be
	generalized to
	inappropriate
	environments (cited
	above in
	discussion of
	his fi'rst
	objection), is
	a reasonable
	one if
	it is made
	with respect
	to distinctions
	found in
	the bioprogram
	(as opposed to
	distinctions supposedly
	innate by  the
	standards of
	other theories).
	An example
	which looks,
	from the
	data available so
	far, somewhat
	like
	


	an
	inappropriate 
	generalization  of
	 the 
	SPD  is 
	found  in 
	data on  the
	


	acquisition of
	Turkish in Slobin
	and Aksu
	(1980).
	


	Turkish has
	two morphemes
	used for
	marking pasHeference
	verbs: {\itshape -dI
	}and
	{\itshape -mis.
	}These are
	used in
	adult speech
	to mark
	direct experience (events
	personally observed
	by the
	speaker) and
	indirect experience
	(events reported
	to or
	inferred by
	the speaker),
	respectively. According
	to Slobin
	and Aksu,
	{\itshape -dI
	}is
	usually acquired
	by age
	1:9,
	and {\itshape 'mls
	}about
	three months
	later (i.e.,
	about the
	same age
	as {\itshape -ing
	}is acÂ·
	quired). But
	&quot;at
	first
	the {\itshape -dI
	}and {\itshape -mis
	}inflections
	differentiate between
	dynamic and 
	static  events
	. .
	. . 
	(C)lear  differentiation
	 of 
	the  two
	


	forms [according
	to their
	adult meanings,
	D.B.] is
	not stabilized
	until.about   4:6.&quot;4
	


	The delay
	in acquisition
	is even
	more significant
	since most
	features of
	Turkish verb
	morphology are fully
	acquired at
	age 3:0. Although
	&quot;evidential&quot;
	tenses are
	found elsewhere 
	(for example,
	in some

	languages  such 
	as  Hopi),  they 
	are  completely 
	un\-known in

	From these 
	two facts,
	we may
	conclude that
	the ditect/inditect 
	experience   distinction
	 does 
	not  form 
	part  of 
	the  bio&shy;
	program,  and
	.we

	Thus,  without  
	a  clear 
	understanding   of
	 the 
	SPD,  the 
	creole  TMA system
	would be
	quite unworkable.
	


	Since  Brown 
	believed   that 
	universality   was
	 the 
	criterion 
	for innateness,
	while the
	criterion for
	the bioprogram 
	theory is
	emergence
	


	\
	


	able to
	reinterpretation in
	the conrse
	of the
	acquisition process.
	Such reinterpretation 
	would  naturally 
	involve  the 
	assumption  that 
	the

	of the
	workings of
	the bioprogram
	as are
	cases of
	early and
	errorless acquisition,
	once the
	mechanisms of
	interaction between
	bioprogram and target
	language are
	adequately understood.
	


	We may
	therefore place
	the SPD
	alongside the
	SNSD as
	a second
	


	semantic distinction
	(with important
	syntactic consequences)
	which is innately
	programmed. But
	consideration of
	the SPD
	naturally prompts
	the question:
	since among
	the most
	distinctive features
	of creoles
	is their
	distinctive TMA
	system, should
	it not
	be the
	case that
	this or
	a similar system
	emerges at
	some stage
	of acquisition,
	if indeed
	a uni&shy;
	versal genetic
	program generates
	such a
	system?
	


	This question  will
	serve to
	focus more
	sharply on
	the nature
	of bioprogram-target
	interaction, briefly
	mentioned two
	paragraphs above.
	In the
	present volume,
	emphasis is
	placed on
	the first
	member of
	the pair, for
	obvious reasons:
	until students
	of acquisition
	are convinced that
	a bioprogram
	is really
	operative, it
	is
	premature to
	talk too
	much about how
	such a
	bioprograrn might
	interact with
	other components
	of the acquisition
	process. But
	such emphasis
	can lead
	all too
	easily to
	a familiar
	straw man:
	the innate
	component which
	is supposed 
	to  roll like
	some irresistible
	juggernaut through
	the years
	of acquisition,
	sweeping all
	other influences
	aside. After 
	the  all
	too easy
	demolition of this
	travesty, the
	empiricist thinks
	he has
	disposed of
	innatism.
	


	In fact, no
	innate program
	could or
	should behave
	in this
	way. From one
	viewpoint, the
	child is
	a biophysical
	organism evolving
	along the genetic
	lines laid
	down for
	its species,
	but from
	another and
	equally valid
	perspective, the
	child is
	a sociocultural
	organism  growing 
	up into membership
	of a
	particular human
	community.  The 
	pressures from the
	second side
	of being
	human must
	inevitably mold
	the impulses of
	the first-the
	more so
	since biophysical
	characteristics are
	typically more
	general and
	cultural characteristics
	more highly
	specified. Thus,
	from an
	early age-certainly
	from  age 
	two  upward-we
	would expect
	that in
	a &quot;natural&quot;
	acquisition situation,
	as distinct
	from  a
	pidgin\-creole one,
	the pattern  of
	the bioprogram
	would be
	gradually shifted
	in the
	direction of
	the target-language
	pattern.
	


	Such  shifting
	must  inevitabl}'.
	affect  the 
	formation
	of a
	TMA

	system. Since
	virtually all
	the relevant 
	literature deals
	with  acquisition
	of particular
	pieces of
	such systems,
	rather than
	with such
	systems as wholes,
	it is
	difficult to
	say at
	what age
	the child 
	fully  controls
	the TMA system
	of his mother
	tongue; but 
	it is
	highly doubtful
	whether such control
	is achieved
	prior to
	age four,
	and likely
	that it
	may come
	considerably later
	than that.
	This means
	that the
	acquisition of
	TMA must spread
	over at
	least two
	years, two
	years during
	which the
	pres\-sure of
	the target
	grammar on
	the evolving
	bioprogram is
	steady and
	continuous. It
	would therefore
	be highly
	unrealistic to
	expect any
	child at any
	stage of
	acquisition to
	exhibit anything
	like a
	fully-developed creole
	TMA system.
	The most
	that we
	could expect
	would be
	that acquisition of
	the earlier
	features of
	TMA systems 
	would  be 
	influ\-enced in
	rather
	oblique ways.
	However, if
	the results
	of such
	influence should prove
	mysterious to
	other theories
	of acquisition,
	yet follow
	logically from
	the present
	one, even
	such oblique
	evidence would
	be significant.
	



	
	


	Accordingly, I
	shall re-examine
	two of
	the  most 
	influential papers on
	the acquisition 
	of  tense: 
	Bronckart  and 
	Sinclair  (1973)
	and Antinucci
	and Miller
	(1976);
	and I
	shall show
	that some puzzling
	features of
	those studies
	become immediately
	 clear 
	once  we  assume
	that while
	the subjects
	of these
	studies appear
	to be
	merely learning
	French and
	Italian, respectively,
	the  bioprogram 
	decisively  influences
	the progress
	of their
	acquisition.
	


	One point
	must be
	made fu:st,
	however. With
	few exceptions,
	students of
	acquisition assume
	that when
	a child
	uses a
	past-tense form, he
	uses it
	because he
	fully understands,
	and deliberately
	intends {\itshape t
	}mark,
	pastness of
	reference.<sup>5</sup><sup>
	</sup>True, it
	is often
	admitted (e.g.,
	by Antinucci
	and Miller
	(1976])
	that the
	child's concept
	of past
	may be
	restricted as
	compared with
	the adult's,
	and may
	extend only
	to past
	events. that
	leave.
	presently-observable
	consequences; but
	it is
	still assumed, without
	question, that
	where past
	marking appears,
	some sort of
	concept of
	past must
	be there
	too.
	


	This by 
	no  means 
	necessarily  follows.
	 All 
	we  can
	say is
	that

	during the period
	in which
	past tense
	is being
	acquired, some
	pastÂ· reference verbs
	are tense.marked
	while some
	are not.
	There are several
	possible  explanations
	of why 
	this is
	so, none
	of which 
	can be
	ruled

	out  a  priori. 
	The child 
	may have
	acquired  a full
	past rule
	but may
	


	apply it
	unpredictably
	because of
	lapses of
	attention,
	phonological
	difficulties, etc.
	The child
	may have
	acquired a
	partial past
	rule which applies
	only to
	a subset
	of past.reference
	verbs. The
	child may
	have acquired
	a rule
	that has
	nothing at
	all to
	do with
	pastness or
	non\-pastness, but
	which just
	happens, coincidentally,
	to mark
	a certain
	percentage of
	past-tense verbs.
	Which of
	these explanations
	is the correct
	one can
	only be
	determined by
	empirical investigation
	in each individual
	case.
	


	Since the
	study of
	variable data
	is much
	further advanced
	in decreolization than
	it
	is
	in
	acquisition, it
	should be
	instructive to
	look at another
	situation where
	variable past-morpheme
	insertion takes
	place. In
	creoles, past
	tense is
	not a
	category. But
	when creoles
	begin to decreolize,
	past-tense markers
	begin to
	be introduced,
	occurring sporadically
	just as
	they do
	in child
	acquisition.
	


	At first,
	one might
	interpret such
	data just
	as similar
	child language data
	have been
	interpreted the
	speakers have
	an established
	past category
	but do
	not always
	mark it.
	However, analyses
	of de&shy;
	creolization in
	both Guyana
	and Hawaii
	(Bickerton 1975:142-61;
	1977:36-51),
	with a
	data base
	of a
	thousand past-reference
	verbs  in both
	cases, suggest
	quite a
	different picture.
	


	On the
	assumption that
	speakers had
	a past
	category, one
	would have to
	conclude that
	decreolizing GC
	speakers randomly
	inserted past morphemes
	27 percent
	of the
	time while
	decreolizing HCE
	speak\-ers did
	so 30
	percent of
	the time.
	However, when
	all past-reference
	verbs were
	divided into
	two categories-those
	that referred
	to SINGLE,
	PUNCTUAL EVENTS,
	and those
	that referred
	to iterative
	or habitual
	events-insertion rates
	were shown
	to vary
	widely between
	the two
	categories, as
	shown in
	Table 3.2:

	Table 3.2
	


	Past versus
	punct ual
	in decreolization
	


	

	
	


	In
	other
	words, what
	was being
	marked  in
	both sets
	of data
	was not really
	pastness, bnt
	rather punctuality.
	


	The punctual-nonpunctual
	distinction (henceforth
	PNPD) is related
	to, yet
	distinct from,
	Â·the
	SPD, and
	is of
	equal importance
	in creole grammar.
	Since both 
	decreolization  and
	 acquisition 
	involve the introduction
	of &quot;past&quot;
	marking where
	none was
	before, it
	should at least
	be worthwhile
	examining acquisitional
	data to
	see whether
	punctuality plays
	the same
	role in
	the second
	as it
	does in
	the f:trst. We
	should certainly
	do well
	to bear
	this possibility
	in mind
	while we
	reconsider previous
	findings on
	past-tense acquisition.
	


	

	
	


	We may
	now turn
	to the
	first of
	the two
	papers cited
	above, Bronckart and
	Sinclair (1973).
	The authors'
	starting point
	was their informal
	observation that
	when children
	were asked
	to describe
	past events, their
	choice of
	tense often
	seemed to
	be influenced 
	by  the nature 
	of the
	event :
	if the
	latter was
	one of
	some duration,
	like washing a
	car, they
	would tend
	to use
	{\itshape il
	lave
	la
	voiture
	}'He washes/is
	washing the car',
	rather  thanii{\itshape a
	lave
	la
	voiture 
	}'He washed
	 the 
	car'; whereas
	if the
	


	event was
	a punctual
	one, like
	kicking a
	ball, they
	would use
	{\itshape ii
	a
	pousse}
	


	{\itshape la
	balle
	
	}'He
	kicked
	the
	ball',
	and
	seldom
	if
	ever
	substitute
	{\itshape il
	pousse 
	la}
	


	{\itshape balle
	}'He
	kicks/is kicking
	the ball'.
	


	Normally,  the 
	opposition  betweenii{\itshape lave
	}andii{\itshape a
	lave
	
	}is treated
	   as a
	simple past-present
	opposition, but
	of course
	this
	is
	not the
	case. The &quot;present&quot;
	tense in
	French is
	in fact
	a nonpunctual
	aspect which does
	not extend
	into the
	past (unlike
	that of
	creoles); but,
	like a
	creole nonpunctual 
	aspect,  it
	embraces  both
	 iterative
	 and 
	Jurative  events.

	OF LANGUAGE
	


	Similarly, the
	&quot;past&quot; is
	not a
	simple past
	in the
	sense of
	English simple
	past. English
	simple past
	is applicable
	to past-punct
	ual and
	past-iterative (but not
	always to
	past-0.urative)
	reference; French
	{\itshape avoir
	}+
	participle is
	limited to
	past punct
	uals, while  past 
	iteratives and 
	past  duratives
	are  rendered 
	by  the 
	so-called  &quot;imperfect&quot;
	 form,
	e.g.,
	{\itshape il
	lavait 
	}rather
	


	thanii{\itshape a
	lave.}
	


	In other
	words, when
	French children
	use different
	verb forms for
	different kinds of
	past events, they
	are doing
	exactly the
	same as creole
	speakers, who 
	always mark
	nonpunctual pasts
	differently  from
	


	punctual pasts.
	


	Bronckart and
	Sinclair confirmed
	and  quantified their
	original observation by
	asking 74
	children to
	describe (after
	the event)
	different types
	of actions
	which  the investigators
	performed with
	the aid
	of a
	series of
	toys. Ages
	of the
	children ranged
	from under
	3 to
	nearly 9. Eleven
	actions were 
	performed. Of
	these, six
	were actions
	which had a
	clear goal
	or result
	(e.g.,
	&quot;a
	car hits
	a marble
	which rolls
	very rapidly
	into a
	pocket&quot;), while
	two were
	actions which
	had no
	perceptible goal
	


	or result
	(e.g.,
	&quot;a
	fish swims
	in
	the basin
	 [circular
	movement J
	&quot;).
	The
	


	three remaining
	&quot;actions,&quot;
	which consisted
	merely of
	cries of
	differing types or
	duration supposedly
	uttered by
	various toys,
	can be
	disre\-garded for
	our purposes.
	


	of
	the six
	goal-0.irected actions,
	some were
	durative and
	others
	


	were not.
	While the
	French {\itshape passe
	compose
	}was used
	more frequently
	for these
	six than
	for the
	two goalless
	actions, there
	was a
	significant
	


	difference  (p  &lt;
	.01) 
	between  durative 
	and  nondurative 
	actions,  the
	


	former  having 
	a  much 
	higher  probability
	 of 
	being  marked 
	with  a nonpast  
	(=
	nonpunctual) 
	verb.  The 
	authors  concluded
	 that 
	&quot;the  disÂ·
	tinction  between 
	perfective  and 
	imperfective  events
	 seems 
	to be  of more 
	importance  than 
	the  temporal 
	relation  between 
	action  and 
	the moment  of 
	enunciation. 
	Imperfective  actions
	 are 
	almost  never 
	ex\-pressed by
	past  tenses, and
	for perfective 
	actions the
	use of
	{\itshape presents}
	


	is the
	more frequent
	the greater
	the probability
	of taking
	into account
	the unaccomplished
	part of
	the action.
	This probability
	is
	partly determined
	by duration,
	frequence, [sic]
	, and
	maybe other
	objective features we
	have not investigated.&quot;
	


	ACQUISITION<sub>	</sub><sub>16</sub><sub>7</sub>
	


	

	
	


	In terms
	of the
	present study, 
	Bronckart  and 
	Sinclair  have
	dearly shown
	that the
	PNPD overrides 
	the  past-nonpast 
	distinction until at
	least the
	age of
	six. However,
	the situation
	in French
	acquisi\-tion may
	be even
	more creole-like
	than the
	authors suggest.
	


	First, they
	fail to
	mention the
	possibility that
	even when
	their subjects seem
	to be
	marking +past,
	they are
	in fuct
	marking +punctual.
	French-speaking children,
	like all
	other children,
	start out
	using the bare
	stem of the
	verb for
	every kind
	of reference,
	past or
	nonpast, punctual or
	nonpunctual, realis
	or irrealis.
	Then, at
	an age
	when devel&shy;
	opmental studies
	suggest that
	they have
	only the
	vaguest idea
	of past time,
	they encounter
	a form
	(the {\itshape passe
	compose)
	}which has
	exclusively punctual
	reference. Note
	that, semantically,
	the categories
	of past
	and punctual overlap.
	While all
	pasts need
	not be
	punctuals, all
	punct uals must
	be pasts-if
	they were
	not, they
	would still
	be happening,
	and if
	they were
	still happening
	now, they
	would be
	nonpunctual by
	defini\-tion. Which
	is likelier-that
	they would
	interpret {\itshape passe
	compose
	}in terms
	of a
	distinction that
	they barely
	yet grasped
	(past-nonpast), or
	that they
	would interpret
	it in
	terms of
	a distinction
	which would
	be apparent to
	them from
	their own
	direct observation
	of actions
	and events
	(punctual-nonpunctual)
	?
	


	Second,
	there are
	a number
	of facts
	about the
	Bronckart and
	Sinclair data
	that the
	authors themselves
	either skim
	over or
	ignore altogether. In
	order to
	understand the
	significance of
	these facts,
	we shall have to
	re-examine their
	study rather
	minutely.
	


	Let
	us begin
	by describing
	the six
	goal-oriented
	actions used
	in
	the study
	and then
	coding them 
	in  terms of 
	type of
	action, duration,
	and iteration
	(where applicable).
	The actions
	(Bronckart and
	Sinclair's 1-6)
	are.as follows:
	


	

	
	


	/16/	A truck
	slowly pushes	car
	toward a
	garage.
	


	/17/	A
	car hits
	a marble
	which very
	rapidly rolls
	into a
	pocket.
	


	/18/   The
	farmer junips
	over ten
	fences and
	reaches the
	farm.
	


	/19/		The
	farmer's wife
	jumps in
	one big
	jump over
	ten fences
	and reaches
	the farm.

	with fairly
	uniform percentages
	of past
	marking across
	all action types.
	In Bronckart
	and Sinclair's
	presentation, I
	think quite
	unin\-tentionally,
	the amount
	of zigzagging
	is reduced
	by showing
	two different graphs
	for durative
	and nondurative
	events; thus,
	certain very
	interesting crossover
	phenomena,  which are
	not  accounted for
	in the
	authors'.conclusions, may
	very easily
	be overlooked.
	


	In  order 
	to  display
	these phenomena, 
	I shall
	recast  Bronckart
	


	and Sinclair's
	data into
	the form
	given in
	Table 3.3
	on the
	following page. In
	this table,
	the six
	actions,
	/16{-/
	21/,
	are ranked
	for each
	of the
	first four
	age groups.
	Rank order
	is based
	on percentage
	of past\-tense
	assignment; thus,
	in each
	column the
	event at the
	head of
	the column is
	that which
	is most
	frequently assigued
	past marking,
	while the event
	at the  foot of
	the  column is
	that to
	which past
	marking is least 
	frequently  assigned.
	 The 
	nondurative  items
	 are 
	circled  in 
	the
	


	table for
	easier
	reference:

	Table 3.3
	presents a
	picture rather
	different from
	that which appears
	in Bronckart
	and Sinclair's
	tables and
	analyses. At
	the earliest
	age, actions
	seem to
	be ranked
	entirely on
	the basis
	of their
	duration, the shortest
	be.ing
	the most
	likely to
	be past-marked.
	The  authors'
	Figure 1
	shows that
	the difference
	between the
	three highest
	ranks in the
	frrst column
	(i.e., those
	actions that
	have a
	duration of
	two seconds or
	less) is
	less than
	ten percentage
	points, while
	there is
	a gap
	of over twenty
	percentage points
	between the 
	lowest  of 
	the  nondurative
	actions and
	the highest
	of the
	durative actions
	(Jx-5).
	


	However, this
	picture gradually
	and progressively
	changes, through the
	next three
	age groups:
	jumping actions
	irrespective  of duration
	tend to
	rise in
	rank, while
	pushing actions
	sink to
	the bottom of
	the table.
	The final
	column shows
	durative and
	nondurative actions
	regularly
	interspersed, but
	the four
	jumping actions
	are now
	all placed
	higher than
	the two
	pushing actions.
	The authors'
	Figure 1shows
	that the
	stratification between
	jumping and
	pushing is quite
	sharp: while
	the


	


	170	<sup>ROOTS</sup><sup>
	</sup><sup>OF</sup><sup>
	</sup><sup>LANGUAGE</sup>
	


	

	
	


	four jumping actions
	in the
	6:6
	column are
	grouped in
	a narrow
	range around the
	90 percent
	past-insertion mark,
	the higher
	of the
	two push\-ing
	actions is
	separated from
	the lowest
	jumping action
	by a
	span of more
	than twenty
	percentage points.
	


	Far from
	there being
	an overall
	rise in
	past marking
	of pushing
	actions, past-marking
	percentages for
	these show
	an absolute
	decline between ages
	4:7 and
	6:6, at
	the same
	time as
	past-marking percentages
	for jumping
	actions are
	rising fairly
	steadily. It
	stretches the
	imagina\-tion to
	suppose that
	children between
	these ages
	begin to
	perceive pushing actions
	as LESS
	past  and
	jumping  actions
	as MORE  past; yet
	if we
	really believe
	that past
	tense is
	all that
	the children
	are ac&shy;
	quiring, we
	have no
	alternative but
	to
	believe
	in improbabilities
	such as
	this.
	


	Bronckart and
	Sinclair note
	some of
	the fluctuations
	mentioned here, but
	attempt to
	account for
	only one
	of them
	, and
	that, perhaps, the
	least significant:
	the drop
	in rank
	for J-2
	(their &quot;event
	 4&quot;)
	 be&shy;
	tween ages
	3:7 and
	4:7. The
	explanation they
	offer is
	that &quot;this
	action took objectively
	more time
	(2 sec.)
	than the
	others (1
	sec.).&quot; By
	&quot;the others&quot;
	the authors
	mean, presumably,
	J-1 and
	P-1, but
	they  are
	a little disingenuous
	here because
	they fail
	to note
	that the
	past-marking rate for
	J-2 ALSO
	FALLS BELOW
	THAT FOR 
	Jx-Swhich  takes
	more than
	twice as
	much time
	as J-2!
	Moreover, the
	rate for
	J-2 is
	only a point
	or two
	higher than
	that for
	Jx-10, which
	is
	five times
	longer! Relative length
	of time,
	therefore, cannot
	be the
	factor involved.
	


	Let  us 
	see  if
	we  can 
	really  determine 
	what  underlies 
	the  phe&shy;
	


	nomena illustrated
	in Table
	3.3. From
	the first
	column, it
	would
	appear that children in
	the lowest
	age group
	do indeed
	discriminate between
	events on
	the basis
	of pure
	length. However,
	as they
	grow older,
	the criterion
	of  durativity 
	is
	replaced 
	by  another 
	which  is 
	also  related to
	the PNPD.
	


	For the
	punctual-nonpunctual 
	opposition  must 
	also
	be marked in
	the semantic
	features of
	individual verbs.
	That is
	to say,
	some verbs are 
	inherently  punctual,
	  while 
	others  are 
	inherently  nonpunctual.

	you jump

	must jump
	many times; both
	{\itshape hit

	on the other
	hand, if

	you do

	push it
	more than

	words, although
	the PNPD
	is
	crucial
	throughout the
	acqu1smon
	of past-tense

	are interpreted

	or any
	difference between 
	iterative  and

	e grouped
	with P-10,
	the only
	truly durative
	event. Thus,
	their JUdgment
	of what
	is nonpunctual
	at age 3:7
	accords with
	the common&shy;
	st ceole
	ju gment
	of what
	is
	nonpunctual:
	that is,
	a merger
	of the
	1terat1ve
	(habitual) with
	the durative
	(progressive).
	


	However, as
	time goes
	by, the
	two Jx
	events are
	reinterpreted s squence
	 of 
	events,  each 
	one  of
	which, considered

	from the
	nopunctual
	category (which
	now contains
	only duratives)
	and re&shy;
	asigned
	to the
	punctual category.
	This judgment-
	merging of
	iteratives with 
	punctuals-corresponds to
	the minority 
	creole pattern 
	found in
	


	Jamaican.Creol:
	and perhaps
	a few
	others referred
	to under the

	(p. 78J.

	up in 
	Broca's
	region. This
	literalistic reading
	of &quot;innate&quot;
	has no
	place in a
	bioprogram theory.
	A true
	bioprogram would
	grow, develop,
	and change just
	as the
	physical organism
	that houses
	it
	grows, develops,
	and changes.
	Increases in
	the child's
	cognitive abilities
	(which o
	course also form
	part of
	the bioprogram
	in its
	widest sense)
	would  mteract with the
	linguistic component
	and progressively
	modify it.
	


	For  the 
	French-speaking  child,
	 the 
	shift  in 
	the nature 
	of  the
	


	nonpunctual category
	would have
	the effect
	of moving
	ma.re
	events into the
	punctual category,
	thus making
	more events
	available for past
	marking. It
	would, in
	other words,
	help the
	child in
	his trai:sfer from
	predominantly punctual
	marking to
	predominantly past
	markmg\-although
	whether this
	result issues
	from the
	hand of
	a beneficent
	providence, or
	is merely
	an accidental
	bonus, it
	is far
	too early
	to tell.
	


	

	
	


	The suggestion
	that children
	may have
	been marking
	punctality
	when they
	seemed to
	have been
	marking pastness
	may still
	see.m
	b12arre to some
	readers. Let
	us, therefore,
	see how
	well it
	stands up
	m
	hght of
	another well-known
	study of
	tense acquisition-that
	of Antinucci
	and
	


	Miller (1976).
	


	Antinucci  and
	Miller found
	that the
	earliest tense
	form used
	by
	


	their sample
	of Italian-speaking
	children  was 
	the past 
	participle.  At
	first this
	always agreed
	in number
	and gender
	with the 
	sentential object,
	suggesting that
	the children
	regarded the
	participles as
	adjectives rather than
	verbs. Then,
	around age
	two, they
	dropped the
	agreement rule and
	began to
	use the 
	participles  in 
	ways  suggesting 
	that  they now
	perceived  them 
	as  true 
	past-tense  verbs 
	(the  usual 
	past  tense in
	Italian consists
	of  auxiliary 
	plus  participle, 
	{\itshape ho
	
	venuto
	
	}'I 
	came', but the
	children almost
	always omitted
	the auxiliary).
	


	However,  the 
	verbs  which 
	children  used
	in this
	way  appeared
	


	to be somewhat
	restricted in
	number. The
	authors divided
	verbs into three
	classes: activity
	verbs (where
	the action
	has no
	end  result)
	, stative verbs,
	and change-of-state
	verbs (such
	as {\itshape close,
	fall,
	give,
	}et':'.) which
	describe actions
	as a
	result of
	which &quot;an 
	object  changes 
	1ts
	state.&quot;  They
	  found  
	that  with  
	vry 
	few  exceptions, 
	children's  past
	


	ACQUISITION<sub>	173</sub>
	


	

	
	


	forms were
	found with
	verbs of
	the last
	class only,
	and they
	concluded that the
	child could
	only assign
	past tense
	to an
	action when
	some\-thing presently
	in his
	physical environment-a
	toy that
	had been
	broken, some
	milk that
	had been
	spilled-remained behind
	as
	a
	concrete result of
	that action.
	


	Now,
	it
	happens
	to
	
	be
	
	the
	
	case
	
	that
	
	change-of-state
	
	verbs
	
	are
	all
	inherently
	punctual;
	the
	rare,
	apparent
	exceptions
	are
	often
	due
	to
	purely
	technological
	developments,
	as
	in
	{\itshape the
	abandoned
	astronaut
	fell

	the
	planet
	for

	even
	sentences
	like
	that
	can
	be
	


	. seen
	to be
	underlyingly punctual
	if we
	apply another
	test for
	inherent punctuality: the
	question, &quot;If
	you stop
	halfway through

	suggest  that
	a punct
	ual analysis
	may account
	for the
	facts better
	than a
	change-of-state
	one. Early
	in their
	third year,
	Italian children
	gener\-ally acquire
	a
	second Italian
	past  tense,
	the imperfect.
	This is
	used with activity
	verbs, but
	is not
	extended to
	change-of-state verbs,
	which continue to
	be
	past-marked with
	participial forms
	(with or without
	auxiliary):

	In other
	words, imperfects
	and participials
	are in
	complementary distribution,
	the first
	being used
	for
	punctual verbs,
	the second
	for nonpunctual ones.
	Note that
	this does
	not reflect
	anything in
	Italian grammar; all
	 Italian 
	verbs,  whether  
	punctual  or 
	nonpunctual,  activity
	or change-of-state
	verbs, have  both
	perfective and
	imperfective  past
	<b>tenses.
	</b><b>,</b>
	


	Antinucci and
	Miller's explanation
	 for 
	this  state 
	of 
	affairs  is
	far from
	satisfactory. They
	note that
	the imperfect
	appears first
	during story-telling, and
	suggest that
	the child
	uses it
	to
	distinguish
	&quot;pretend&quot; from
	real events.
	But if
	this were
	really the
	case, we
	would expect
	use of the
	imperfect to
	be extended
	to all
	types of
	verbs, including
	change\-of-state
	verbs; for
	surely change-of-state
	(or punct
	ual) verbs
	can be
	used to describe
	imaginary events
	as easily
	as activity
	(or nonpunctual)
	verbs. Moreover,
	in the
	examples that
	Antinucci and
	Miller  them&shy;
	selves cite,
	such as /22/
	and /23/
	above, the
	events of
	{\itshape staying 
	}and {\itshape crying,
	}rendered by
	the imperfect,
	are no
	more (or
	less) &quot;pretend&quot;
	events than
	the events
	of {\itshape going
	
	}and {\itshape putting,
	
	}which  are
	 rendered  by the
	participial form.	,

	It is
	therefore highly
	possible that
	the connection
	observed by the 
	athors
	 bet&quot;'.'ee 
	&quot;pretend&quot; evnts
	and  the
	imperfect  is
	merely a
	part1 .and
	comc1den
	tal one.
	It 1s
	hard to
	tell, since
	they present no
	stat1st1cal
	data that
	would serve
	to quantify
	the distribution
	of participial
	and imperfective
	forms in
	realis and
	irrealis contexts.
	And if their
	hypothesis is
	falsified even
	by the
	few sentences
	they themselves
	choose {\itshape to
	}cite,
	and if
	both tenses
	are past-reference
	in adult
	speech, then there
	is
	nothing
	but the
	PNPD
	to prevent
	children from
	general\-izing the
	more regular,
	imperfect form
	to change-of-state
	verbs just as
	English children
	generalize {\itshape -ed
	}to irregular
	pasts.	'
	


	

	
	


	Inded,
	hw
	is it
	that English
	children generalize
	in this
	way when
	Italian children
	do not?
	If everyone
	has the
	same bioprogram,
	how com.e
	everyone doesn't
	learn the
	same way?
	Let us
	explore this
	problem 1Il
	some depth,
	for by
	so doing
	we will
	not only
	answer these and
	other questions,
	but we
	will also
	better understand
	how the
	same
	


	bioprogram   can 
	yield  superficially
	 different 
	results  when 
	it  interacts with
	two languages
	that differ
	in structure.
	


	First,  let 
	us  dispose 
	of  a
	possible objection.
	It might 
	be  argued tat 
	the   two  
	processes-
	Irian-speaking   children
	  learning  
	first  parti&shy;
	ciples, then
	llnperfects;
	English-speaking children
	learning first
	irregular, then   regular
	  pasts-are
	 not  
	really   commensurate.
	 So 
	they  are 
	not, from  an
	
	adult 
	point  of 
	view.  But 
	the  child  does
	not  have 
	an  adult point 
	of  view, 
	and  for
	the  child 
	they  must 
	be  completely 
	commen\-surate. The
	adult  knows
	that Italian
	has two
	tense forms
	with different
	meanings, whereas
	English has
	only a
	single form,
	expressed in
	diverse ways. But
	there is
	no way
	a child
	could know
	this unless
	he were
	born with  a
	comparative  grammar
	 of
	Inda-European  in his
	head, as
	well as {\itshape Aspects.
	
	}Remember, the
	children  we
	are 
	talking about
	are under
	three. Not  only 
	can  they 
	not  have 
	the  slightest
	 idea
	what  the
	mat ure
	tense system  of 
	their  languages 
	will  eventually 
	look like, 
	but  even 
	on the most 
	favorable  accounts,
	 they 
	can  have 
	only  the
	vaguest  notion 
	of
	


	what past 
	means,  and
	by  some 
	accounts,  they  can
	have no
	notion at all.

	What must
	really happen
	is something
	like the
	following. Around
	age two,
	the child
	who happens
	to be
	learning Italian
	becomes aware of
	a set
	of rather
	irregular forms,
	which are
	past-reference forms
	in adult grammar
	(the Italian
	participles), whereas
	the child
	who happens to
	be learning
	English also becomes
	aware of
	a set
	of rather
	irregular forms, which
	are also
	past-reference forms
	in adult
	speech (the
	English &quot;strong&quot;
	past tenses).
	Shortly afterward,
	the child
	learning Italian
	encounters a
	set of
	quite regular
	forms, once 
	again  past-reference
	forms in
	adult speech
	(the Italian
	imperfective),  while,
	 around 
	the same time,
	the child
	learning English
	also encounters
	a set
	of regular forms
	that are
	past-reference forms
	in adult
	speech (the
	English &quot;weak&quot;
	past tenses).
	


	Up until
	this point, the
	experiences of
	the two
	children have been
	, from
	their point
	of view,
	identical. I
	defy anyone
	to explain how
	those experiences
	could be
	differently interpreted
	by the
	two children-except in
	a single
	respect, which
	we shall
	deal with
	shortly. From
	the child's
	point of
	view, in
	both cases
	he has
	begun by
	finding some
	irregular fors
	that mean
	past (from
	the traditional
	perspective) or
	punctual (from
	the perspective
	of this
	volume), and
	he has
	gone on to find
	some regular
	forms that
	also mean
	past (from
	the traditional
	perspective).
	


	But now,
	the Italian
	learner and
	the English
	learner part
	com\-pany. The
	Italian learner
	keeps the
	two sets
	of forms,
	the regular
	and the irregular,
	completely separate,
	applying one
	set to 
	one class
	of verbs and
	the other
	to another.
	The English
	learner, on
	the contrary,
	proceeds to
	generalize the
	regular set
	to the
	irregular set,
	applying &quot;weak&quot;
	tense endings
	to &quot;strong&quot;
	verbs in
	defiance of
	adult
	grammar rules. Why
	? Why
	doesn't the
	Italian learner
	make a
	similar generaliza&shy;
	tion? Or, to
	put it
	differently, why 
	doesn't the
	English learner
	make the same
	kind of
	distinction as
	the Italian
	learner,  maintaining the
	irregular forms
	(like {\itshape came,
	went,
	bought,
	sold,
	gave,
	broke-all
	}good changes-ofstate,
	note) for
	punctual verbs,
	and saving
	the {\itshape -ed
	}affix
	for activity
	verbs?
	


	To understand
	the answer,
	we have
	to get
	used to
	looking at
	the
	


	\
	


	ACQUISITION<sub>	177</sub>
	


	acquisition process
	in a
	way it
	has not
	been looked
	at hitherto-even
	though e.verything
	w.e
	know about
	language points
	to that
	way as
	the mst
	logical and
	fr1tful.
	Als,
	the &quot;order
	of acquisition&quot;
	gambit  set child
	language studies
	back fifteen
	years by
	concentrating exclusively
	on the
	acquisition of
	isolated features.
	Small wonder
	if,
	as we
	have seen, the
	sterility of
	this approach
	sent acquisitionists
	gamboling off
	across the
	meadows of
	pragmatics, cognition,
	&quot;motherese,&quot; 
	etc., which
	were not
	much more
	irrelevant to
	the central
	problem of
	syntax acquisition, but
	a good
	?eal less
	dull. For
	what both
	groups forgot was
	that lauage
	IS
	a tight
	system composed
	of even
	tighter sub&shy;
	systems. Children
	do not
	learn individual
	morphemes in
	isolation from
	


	one another;
	they build
	up subsystems
	and at
	the same
	time integrate
	those subsystems
	into an
	overall system.
	


	The situation
	was not 
	helped  any 
	by the
	primitive  state
	of the art
	in TMA
	studies, in
	spite of
	(I would 
	prefer  to
	say,  because 
	of) wo'.k in
	the field
	from Reichenbach
	(1947) to
	Comrie (1976)
	and Wo1setschlaeger
	(1977). We
	shall return 
	to  this 
	issue  in 
	Chapter  4;
	for. the
	.moment, 
	suffice  it
	
	to  say 
	that  an 
	approach  like 
	Comrie's,
	


	-;h1ch
	tries to
	extract some
	kind of
	Platonic
	core meaning
	from terms like 
	&quot;perfective&quot; 
	and  &quot;imperfective,&quot;
	 totally  
	ignores   the  
	fact  that the
	units  of
	grammatical  subsystems
	cannot  be
	defined  independently
	of those
	systems-that, in
	consequence, what
	&quot;perfective&quot;
	and &quot;im&shy;
	perfec.tive&quot;
	mean, .in
	any  subsystem 
	where  such 
	labels are
	applicable,
	


	IS
	entirely determmed
	 by how
	many other
	units that
	subsystem has and
	what the
	other units mean.
	


	

	
	


	Once this
	viewpoint is
	established, we
	can proceed
	to look
	at the .u:quisition
	of TMA
	systems AS
	SYSTEMS, bearing
	in mind
	all the while
	the injunction
	of the
	bioprogram; &quot;Make
	sure that
	punctuals and nonpuncts
	are adequately
	differentiated.&quot;
	We may
	then repre&shy;

	the PNPD,
	while Italian
	learners have
	marked only
	one side.
	For them,
	nonpunctuals are
	yet to
	be marked,
	so instead
	of generalizing
	the imperfect, they
	 seize 
	on  it 
	as  their 
	nonpunctual  marker
	 and 
	keep it
	carefully separate
	from their
	marker of
	punctuality ,
	the participial
	form.
	


	Note that
	without the
	bioprogram the
	differences in
	behavior between Italian
	and English
	learners are
	quite inexplicable.
	In
	virtually identical
	circumstances, the
	 English 
	learner 
	over-generalizes,
	 while
	the Italian
	learner
	under-generalizes.
	However, once
	we see
	that English and
	Italian learners
	are equipped
	with an
	identical program,
	but still
	satisfying the
	requirements of
	that program
	in  a
	different  order-an
	order determined
	by the
	interaction of
	the bioprogram
	with two different
	languages-such
	differences are
	not merely
	explicable, but
	follow inevitably
	from the
	theory presented
	here.
	


	

	
	


	Now we
	can better
	understand what
	the child
	of a
	first creole
	generation does.
	When that
	child is
	around 18
	to 21
	months old,
	his TMA &quot;system&quot;
	and the
	TMA &quot;system&quot;
	of his
	parents' pidgin
	exactly coincide; both
	consist of
	the &quot;universal
	base&quot; shown 
	at the
	left-hand side of
	Figure 3.1.
	The only
	difference between
	the child's
	trying to learn
	a pidgin
	and the
	child's trying
	to learn
	French or
	Italian is
	that the
	latter will
	be offered
	a variety
	of verb
	forms which
	he can
	then interpret according
	 to 
	the  specifications
	 of 
	his  bioprogram, 
	while the former
	will not
	be  offered 
	anything  new 
	in
	the  way  of
	 forms. The
	creole child
	therefore  decides
	to mark 
	the  nonpunctual 
	side  of the
	opposition.
	


	Two questions
	may be
	asked here:
	why does
	the creole
	child decide, apparently
	without exception,
	to mark
	nonpunctuals rather
	than punctuals,
	and why
	does he
	not mark
	both terms
	of the
	opposi&shy;
	tion, as
	I have
	claimed that
	both English
	and Italian
	children do?
	


	I think
	that nonpunctuals
	rather than
	punctuals are
	marked because, from
	a pragmatic
	viewpoint, nonpunctuals
	 represent 
	the marked case
	in a
	Jakobsonian sense:
	in  the 
	real world, 
	more actions are 
	punctual  than 
	nonpunctual;  punctual
	 actions 
	constitute the
	back-
	


	'
	


	ACQUISITION<sub>	</sub><sub>1</sub><sub>81</sub>
	


	

	
	


	ground against
	which nonpunctual
	actions
	stand out.
	Regarding the
	second question,
	we should
	rather ask, 
	why  do 
	noncreole  children
	mark both
	terms? The
	answer to
	that clearly
	is because
	noncreole children
	receive, if
	anything, too
	great a
	variety of
	forms-greater,
	certainly, than
	any two-year-old
	can incorporate 
	into  a 
	coherent system. The
	child feels
	obliged to
	assign some
	kind of
	significance to
	terms with
	which he
	is constantly 
	bombarded,  so
	he assumes
	that in the
	language confronting
	him both
	sides of
	the PNPD
	are formally
	marked.
	


	But, of
	course, both
	sides of
	an opposition
	do not
	have to
	be formally marked-it
	serves to
	distinguish them
	if you
	formally mark
	one term
	and zero-mark
	the other.
	Considerations of
	parsimony alone
	would
	indicate such
	a choice,
	if the opportunity
	presents itself
	(and for the
	creole child,
	it
	does). It
	is quite
	enough trouble
	for the
	creole child
	


	to
	select,  from
	the pidgin, 
	one  content-word  (like
	HPE  locative
	{\itshape stei)}
	


	to mark
	one term
	of the
	opposition,
	without having
	to search 
	out another
	to mark
	the  other.
	In  both 
	cases,  albeit 
	by  differen
	t means, the
	demands of
	the bioprogram
	are satisfied.
	


	I have
	little doubt
	that  when 
	acquisitionists  begin
	 to 
	study TMA.
	acquisition  from
	a dynamic,
	systems-oriented
	standpoint, and
	with.the tools
	of variation
	analysis already
	available from
	decreolization studies,
	many more
	of the
	effects of
	the bioprogram
	will  become
	visible. For
	the present,
	we must
	leave that
	area and
	survey rather
	more briefly some
	others in
	which resemblances
	between creoles
	and acqui&shy;
	sitional stages
	are to
	be found.
	We shall
	look at
	just four
	areas: comple&shy;
	mnt
	Ss, questions,
	negatives,
	and causatives.
	


	

	
	


	A rec.et
	overview of
	complex sentence
	acquisition (Bowerman
	1979) 
	draws  heavily 
	on  Brown 
	(1973)
	and  Limber 
	(1973),
	which

	surprising, since
	Brown
	devotes less
	than a
	page (p.
	21) to
	sen\-tential
	complemen ts,
	and Umber's
	only slightly
	longer (six.
	-page) treatment  leaves
	 many
	crucial  questions
	 unasked. 
	However,  much 
	of

	by these
	scholars is
	highly suggestive.

	Brown cites
	four examples 
	only  of 
	complement  Ss 
	produced by children:
	


	

	
	


	/24/
	 
	I
	hope
	{\itshape I
	don't
	hurt
	it.}
	


	/25/
	 
	I
	think
	{\itshape it's
	the
	wrong
	way.}
	


	/26/
	  
	I
	mean
	{\itshape that's
	a
	D.}
	


	/27/
	
	You
	think
	{\itshape I
	can
	do
	it?}
	


	

	
	


	Brown comments
	that &quot;the
	embedded sentence
	appears exactly
	as it would if
	it
	stood
	alone as
	an independent
	simple sentence.&quot;He
	observes that
	there are
	other types
	of complement
	S of
	which this
	is
	not true,
	such as:
	


	

	
	


	/28/
	  
	It
	annoys
	the
	neighbors
	{\itshape for
	John
	to
	play
	
	the
	bugle.}
	


	

	
	


	He
	does not
	state whether
	or not
	the children
	in his
	sample produced
	sentences like
	/28/, but
	the implication
	is that
	they did
	not. He
	does observe,
	however, that
	&quot;there is
	also a
	complementizer  {\itshape that&quot;
	}which can
	occur in
	sentences like
	/24/-/27 /;
	but  &quot;the
	children  did 
	not  use <b>it.n</b>
	


	Limber's data
	are more
	problematic in
	that  it 
	is  not 
	always clear from
	his treatment
	whether a
	given example
	is an
	actual child
	utterance or
	one presented
	for heuristic
	purposes. Thus,
	although Limber
	states that
	&quot;marked infinitive&quot;
	is acquired
	early, this
	is
	not clearly
	the case
	from the
	example
	given: {\itshape I
	want
	to
	go.
	}If,
	as seems
	probable, this
	is just
	an orthographic
	regularization of
	the actual
	utterance, {\itshape I
	wanna
	go
	}(a
	likelihood increased
	by the
	fact that
	Limber himself includes
	a similar
	form, {\itshape hafta,
	}in his
	Table 1),
	then it
	is not
	at all
	clear {\itshape from
	the
	viewpoint
	of
	what
	the
	child
	 (as
	opposed
	to
	the
	adult)
	knows
	}that
	the child
	has acquired
	marked infmitives.
	Consider the
	following sentences,
	which  few
	children can
	have failed 
	to hear or
	failed to
	produce themselves:
	


	

	
	


	/29/   I
	wanna cookie
	(unambiguous noun).
	


	\
	


	ACQUISITION<sub>	</sub><sub>1</sub><sub>83</sub>

	verb).
	


	

	
	


	Faced with
	such data,
	the most
	reasonable conclusion
	on the
	part of the
	child would be
	that the
	canonical form
	of the
	verb was
	{\itshape wanna
	}rather than
	{\itshape want-or
	}that,
	at the
	very least,
	{\itshape hafta,
	liketa,
	wanna
	}should be.
	entered in
	the lexicon
	as variant
	(perhaps phonologically
	condi&shy;
	tioned) forms
	of the
	verb stems
	concerned. Such,
	certainly, is
	the assumption
	made by
	Brown (1973:54)
	when establishing
	rules for
	the alculation
	of mean
	length of
	utterance: {\itshape &quot;gonna,
	wanna,
	hafta
	.
	}.
	.
	[were]counted
	as single
	morphemes rather
	than as
	{\itshape going
	to
	}or {\itshape want
	to
	}because
	evidence is
	that they
	function so
	for the
	children.&quot;
	


	The following
	series of
	examples represents,
	with one
	exception, all the
	sentential complement
	forms cited
	by Limber
	which we
	can
	assume to
	be examples
	of actual
	child speech:
	


	

	
	


	/32/
	
	lwant
	{\itshape mommy
	do
	it.}
	


	Â·/33/
	 
	I
	don't
	want
	{\itshape you
	read
	that
	book.}
	


	/34/
	
	Watch
	{\itshape me
	draw
	circles.}
	


	/35/
	 
	I
	see
	{\itshape you
	sit
	down.}
	


	/36/
	  Lookit
	{\itshape a
	boy
	play
	ball.}
	


	

	
	


	If
	we look
	at these
	five examples
	together with
	the four
	cited by Brown
	(and these,
	strange to
	say, seem
	to be
	virtually the
	only coniplement-S
	constructions cited
	in the 
	literature),  we 
	will  note first
	that not  one
	of them
	has an
	overt complementizer,
	and second,
	


	that
	with  the
	exception  of
	/34/ the
	complements  could
	stand on
	their own  as
	independent 
	simple sentences.
	Moreover,  since
	{\itshape me
	}as
	subject
	


	has.
	been widely
	reported for
	black children,
	it is
	by no
	means
	certain that for
	the speaker
	of /34/,
	{\itshape me
	draw
	circles
	}would
	be ungrammatical;
	and
	even if
	it were,
	the analogy
	with {\itshape watch
	me,
	mommy!-an
	}utterance surely
	developmentally prior
	to /34/-may
	be what
	is operative
	ln this
	case.
	


	It is
	true that 
	we cannot
	point  to
	the same
	kind of
	evidence

	we used
	in Chapter
	2, when
	the same
	question of
	finite versus
	non\-finite analysis
	was at
	issue; we cannot
	point to
	t,he presence
	of markers of
	tense or
	aspect in
	the embedded
	sentence. But
	it would
	be illegiti&shy;

	expect  such

	established and
	that there is
	no evidence,
	as there
	seems not
	to
	be, for
	any VP
	constituent):


	


	examples are
	taken (1
	:6 to
	3:0), the
	vast majority
	of children's
	verb forms consist
	of unmarked
	stems anyway.
	


	The  only 
	example  of 
	Limber's 
	which  was
	11ot
	 cited 
	above  is:
	


	/39/	S -+
	NP   V

	})


	


	

	
	


	/37{\itshape I
	
	}I
	all
	done
	eating.
	


	

	
	


	This might
	at first
	seem like
	a clear
	case of
	a nonf&quot;mite
	complement S. But
	Limber himself
	explicitly 
	observes  that in
	his recordings
	there is
	no trace
	of &quot;a
	variety of
	{\itshape -ing
	}complements;
	for example,
	{\itshape I
	like
	eating
	lollipops
	}in
	contrast to
	the very
	common {\itshape I
	like
	to
	eat
	lollipops&quot;
	}(which, as
	already suggested,
	is more
	probably a
	case of
	a quasi-modal
	{\itshape liketa).
	}He
	further comments
	that nonf&quot;mite
	{\itshape ing
	}forms
	(as distinct
	from the &quot;finite
	{\itshape -ing&quot;
	}discussed
	in a
	previous section)
	occurred only
	in sentences
	like /37
	/,
	i.e., &quot;with
	{\itshape finish
	}or {\itshape all
	done.&quot;
	}Although
	Limber himself
	does not
	explicitly draw
	it, it
	would seem
	legitimate to
	draw the
	conclusion that {\itshape finish
	}and {\itshape all
	done
	}are
	interpreted by
	the child
	either as
	quasi\-modals
	followed by
	&quot;fmite
	{\itshape -ing&quot;
	}or as
	main verbs
	followed by  NP.
	Either way,
	/37/
	would not
	be relevant
	to the
	present
	discussion.
	


	Limber goes
	on to
	&quot;informally
	summarize&quot; the
	major develop&shy;
	ments in
	complex sentences
	prior to
	age three
	in the
	following manner:
	&quot;An
	N-V-N sequence
	is
	the common
	simple sentence
	..
	. .
	[children] expand
	(or substitute)
	an N-V-N
	sequence for
	certain noun
	phrases ..
	.
	


	[butJ
	
	do  not 
	apply  syntactic 
	operations
	to any
	subject NPs.&quot;
	Brown
	


	(1973:21) also
	observed that
	sentences of
	the type
	of /38/
	below did not
	occur in
	child speech:
	


	

	
	


	/38/
	 
	{\itshape That
	John
	called
	early
	}annoyed
	Bill.
	


	

	
	


	Stated more
	formally ,
	Limber's study
	would suggest 
	that  children
	have only 
	the  following 
	major PS
	rule  (assuming
	that Aux

	in Chapter
	2
	are quite
	striking. They
	include:
	


	

	
	<ol>
		<li/>


The
		absence of
		embedded sentences
		in subject
		position.
		<li/>



		The absence
		of complementizers.
	</ol>
	


	3)
	The identity
	of form
	between embedded
	and nonembedded
	sentences.
	


	4)
	The absence
	of nonfinite
	and subjectless
	embeddings.
	


	

	
	


	In addition,
	we may
	note the
	similarity of
	/39/ to
	the major creole
	PS rule
	/236/,
	Chapter 2,
	hypothesized on
	quite independent
	grounds for
	all early-stage
	creoles, and
	repeated here
	for convenience as
	/40/:
	


	

	
	


	/40/   S
	-+ NP
	Aux V
	(NP) (S)
	


	

	
	


	Rule /40/
	is merely
	a slightly
	more sophisticated
	version of
	/39/, as would
	befit its
	more mature 
	users, differing
	only in
	that it
	admits an
	established Aux:
	and allows
	for
	object NP
	as well
	as complement
	S in the
	same sentence,
	instead of only
	admitting these
	as alternatives.
	


	Of
	the
	similarities
	listed, the
	first three
	are self-explanatory,
	but perhaps
	a
	word should
	be said
	about the
	fourth, which
	relates to the
	absence from child
	speech of
	sentences like
	{\itshape I
	like
	eating
	lolli&shy;
	pops
	}and
	from creoles
	of sentences
	like /41/
	or /42/:

	while
	/41/

	an

	so
	the
	reasons
	for
	their
	ungrammaticality
	cannot
	be
	the
	samebut
	I
	would
	like
	to
	suggest
	a
	reason
	why
	both
	creoles
	and
	children
	should
	reject
	sentences
	on
	the
	model
	of
	J
	{\itshape like

	If
	children
	learned
	language
	primarily
	on
	the
	basis
	of
	analogy,
	the
	absence
	 of
	such
	sentences
	would
	be
	mysterious.
	The
	child
	would
	observe
	some
	specific
	questions
	and
	answers:
	


	

	
	


	{\itshape {43{
	 
	}What
	are
	you
	eating?
	Cookies.
	


	/44/
	 
	What
	are
	you
	playing
	with?
	My
	ball.
	


	

	
	


	Answers
	to
	such
	questions
	fit
	well
	into
	the
	frame,
	{\itshape I
	like
	.
	}.
	{\itshape .:}
	


	

	
	


	/45/
	 
	I
	like
	cookies.
	


	{\itshape /46{
	 
	}I
	like
	my
	ball.
	


	

	
	


	Once
	the
	child
	had
	acquired
	&quot;finite
	{\itshape -ing,&quot;
	}he
	would
	be
	able
	to
	answer
	slightly
	less
	explicit
	questions
	with
	{\itshape -ing
	}forms:
	


	

	
	


	/47/	What
	are
	you
	doing?
	Eating
	cookies.
	


	/48/	What
	are
	you
	doing?
	Playing
	ball.
	


	

	
	


	By
	analogy
	with
	/45/,
	/46/,
	these
	ought
	to
	yield:
	


	

	
	


	/49/	I
	like
	eating
	cookies.
	


	/
	50/	I
	like
	playing

	not
	necessarily
	either
	punctual
	or
	nonpunctual,
	in
	irrealis
	time.
	The
	superficial
	identity
	of
	the
	forms
	involved
	is
	an
	illusory
	one,
	and
	the

	for
	all
	the

	he
	is
	supposed
	to

	is
	not

	the

	chosen
	to
	mark
	nonpunctual
	cannot
	be
	assigned
	any
	other
	function.
	


	We
	mayjustifiably
	conclude,
	then,
	that
	the
	mechanisms
	of
	child
	


	language
	and
	creoles
	for
	incorporating

	are

	the

	all of 
	this,  why 
	should  children  take
	 a
	form that 
	clearly  belongs 
	in answers and use
	it to
	make questions?
	


	If we
	assume a
	language bioprogram,
	however, a
	much more
	reasonable explanation
	emerges. The
	bioprogram would
	enjoin just
	that biuniqueness in
	form-function and
	form-meaning
	relationships which
	children strive
	for and
	which creoles,
	with a large
	measure of
	success, attain. In
	this, it
	merely follows
	the pattern
	of genetic
	programs in
	general, which
	do not
	prescribe sets
	of alternative
	routines, but
	leave open the
	possibility of
	adapting given
	routines for
	other purposes.
	


	One resource
	in the
	bioprogram is
	constituent  movement.
	 We will
	not directly
	consider  movement
	 rules 
	in  this
	chapter, although
	we considered
	them in
	the first
	two, simply
	because not
	enough work has
	been done
	on the
	acquisition of
	movement rules
	for any
	valid comparisons to
	be drawn.
	But it
	would appear
	from creoles
	that inove&shy;
	ment has,
	as the
	overall model
	would suggest,
	only one
	function\-expressing
	shifts from
	the expected
	pattern of
	focus and
	presupposi\-tion.
	Certainly no
	creole rule
	that  I
	know  of
	moves  any 
	constituent for any
	other reason
	than this.
	


	English, therefore,
	goes contrary
	to the
	bioprogram when
	it uses a
	movement rule-subject-aux
	inversion-to distinguish
	between ques&shy;
	tions and
	statements. The
	child, therefore,
	either fails
	to hear
	correctly or simply
	ignores the
	sentences that
	depart so
	radically from
	his expec&shy;
	tations. Eventually
	(perhaps as
	a result
	of misunderstandings;
	it would be
	interesting to
	have some
	&quot;caregiver
	interaction&quot; data on
	this) the child
	observes that
	subject-aux inversion
	is required
	in yes-no
	questions. Two factors
	could reasonably
	be expected
	to delay
	the generalization
	of this
	rule to
	WH-questions. First,
	WH-questions are
	unambiguously marked by
	the initial
	WH-word, so
	that misunderstanding
	is corre&shy;
	spondingly less
	likely to
	occur.  Second, 
	the fact 
	that  WH-questions
	are already
	formally distinguishable
	from statements
	could well
	deter the child
	from applying
	what, to
	him, would
	be a
	quite redundant
	rule-why
	mark a
	question as
	a question
	twice over?
	


	Finally, of
	course, he
	has to
	capitulate; the
	child learning
	a creole does 
	not.  The 
	yes-no  questions 
	of  children

	second  stage 
	and the
	WH-questions of
	children in
	their third
	stage are
	identical with
	the yes-no
	and WH-questions
	cited in
	Chapter 2.
	


	Let us
	turn to
	negation where,
	again, the
	findingsÂ· of
	Klima and Bellugi
	( 1966)
	have hardly
	been superseded 
	(except,  again,
	that  they may
	not have
	paid enough
	attention to
	individual differences).
	At the earliest
	stage  of 
	negation,  a 
	negative  morpheme-
	occasionally  {\itshape not,
	}most often
	no-is placed
	at the
	beginning or 
	end  of 
	the  utterance.
	These forms
	persist into
	the second
	stage, but
	here, one
	or two
	spe\-cialized
	negative forms,
	such as
	{\itshape don't
	}or
	{\itshape can't,
	}are
	also acquired.
	Since {\itshape cannot
	}and {\itshape do
	not
	}never
	appear at
	this stage,
	we can
	conclude that
	for the child, {\itshape can't
	}and
	{\itshape don't
	}constitute
	monomorphemic utterances.
	Also these forms 
	seem  to 
	be  more 
	restricted  in 
	distribution  than
	they  are in
	adult language;
	{\itshape don't
	}seems
	to be
	confined (in
	Klima and
	Bellugi's examples, at
	least )
	to stative
	verbs and
	imperatives.
	


	{\itshape Can't
	}and
	{\itshape don't
	}are,
	presumably, superimposed
	on the
	bio\-program by
	sheer force
	of parental
	repetition; I
	know of
	no statistics on
	the subject
	, but
	casual observation
	alone suggests
	that these
	must be among
	the most
	frequent words
	addressed to
	small children-perhaps
	to creole
	speakers too;
	for I
	cannot resist
	interrupting this
	account to
	describe two
	striking similarities
	between acquisition
	and, this
	time, decreolization.
	


	

	
	


	It may
	seem illogical
	at first
	to compare
	acquisition with
	de\-creolization in
	a study
	whose main
	thrust is
	the comparison
	of acquisi&shy;
	tion and
	creolization; but
	regarding later
	stages of
	acquisition, such
	comparisons are
	apt and
	pertinent. The
	position of
	the bioprogram&shy;
	activating child
	vis-a-vis the
	target-language-enforcing
	adult is
	highly comparable to
	the position
	of the
	creole speaker 
	vis-a-vis  the 
	super\-strate
	speaker. Both
	adult and
	superstrate speaker
	 believe 
	that  both child
	and creole
	speaker are speaking
	merely a
	&quot;broken&quot; form
	of their own
	&quot;proper&quot;
	language. Both child
	and creole
	speaker are
	eventually forced to
	modify their
	natural behavior
	by the
	bombardment from
	above.<sup>8</sup><sup>
	</sup>With  regard
	 to 
	changes  in 
	negative  forms, 
	the  results
	seem to 
	be  identical.

	before Aux
	in surface
	structure; in
	the decreolization
	of both
	languages, the thin
	end of
	the wedge
	of English
	negative placement
	(i.e., in
	surface structure
	as the
	second member
	of Aux)
	consists of
	adoption of
	the negative form
	of {\itshape can
	}(GC
	{\itshape kyaan,
	}HCE {\itshape k
	aenat
	)
	}to
	replace, respectively,
	GC {\itshape na
	kyan,
	}HCE {\itshape no
	k
	aen.
	Kyaan
	}and
	{\itshape kaenat
	}are
	both perceived
	and treated
	as monomorphemic
	units. In
	GC, {\itshape kyaan
	}is
	first acquired,
	and {\itshape doon
	}(the
	equivalent of
	{\itshape don't
	)
	}is
	acquired second
	and some
	time later in
	the
	decreolization process;
	in HCE,
	{\itshape kaenat
	}and {\itshape don
	}are
	acquired around the
	same time.
	In GC,
	exactly as
	in child language,
	{\itshape doon
	}is initially
	applied
	to statives,
	imperatives, and
	little else
	(see Bickerton
	[197S:Table
	3.9]
	, where
	these two 
	types  account 
	for  84
	percent of the
	output of
	early {\itshape doon
	}users);
	comparable figures
	are, unfortunately,
	unavailable for
	HCE.
	


	

	
	


	We return
	{\itshape now
	}to the
	normal evolution
	of child
	negatives. Around the
	time that
	{\itshape don't
	}and
	{\itshape can't
	}make 
	their  first 
	appearance, there also
	appear sentences
	such as
	the following:
	


	

	
	


	/58/   That
	no fish
	school.
	


	/59/
	 
	He
	no
	bite
	you.
	


	/60/   I
	no want
	envelope.
	


	

	
	


	These sentences
	find exact
	parallels not
	in decreolization,
	but in
	the classic
	form of
	creole negative
	sentences. As
	in creoles,
	the negative
	morpheme is
	identical
	with  the 
	morpheme  of
	denial. As
	in  creoles, the
	negative morpheme
	is
	inserted  directly
	 after
	the  subject,
	before any verbal
	or auxiliary
	element, rather
	than sentence-externally
	(as in the
	first
	phase of
	child negation)
	or after a
	first
	auxiliary or
	verbal constituent (as
	in English).
	This second
	similarity is
	maintained even
	after {\itshape no
	}begins
	to be
	replaced by
	{\itshape not:}
	


	

	
	


	/61/   He
	not taking
	the walls
	down.
	


	/62/  
	Ask me
	if I
	not made
	mistake.

	ln part,
	at least,
	these developments
	are natural,
	perhaps inevit\-able.
	At the
	two-word stage 
	there is
	nowhere the
	child could
	put a negative
	except
	sentence-externally.
	Moreover, since
	{\itshape no
	}is
	heard as
	an isolated unit
	with heavy
	emphasis, while
	{\itshape not
	}often
	occurs in
	contracted forms which
	may be
	unrecognizable to
	the child,
	it is
	hardly surprising
	that {\itshape no
	}rather
	than {\itshape not
	}is
	selected for
	sentence negation.
	


	It is
	less clear
	why negative
	placement in
	longer sentences
	takes the position
	it does.
	To judge
	from the
	examples cited
	above, that
	placement involves
	post-subject, rather
	than preverbal,
	placement\-inapplicable
	in /58/
	which has
	no verb--or
	second position
	in sentence&shy;
	ruled out
	by /62/
	where a
	subordinate
	clause is
	negated. Yet there
	is no support
	for a
	&quot;post-subject&quot;
	hypothesis in
	English. One
	might claim
	that the
	child knows
	roughly where
	the negative
	should go
	but doesn't yet
	have any
	auxiliary to
	place in
	front of
	it, so
	he ru:rives
	at
	post\-subject
	placement by
	default, so
	to speak.
	This may
	sound plausible at
	first. But
	note that
	post-subject placement
	is
	arrived at
	BEFORE the child acquires
	{\itshape not-not
	}merely
	usurps the
	place  staked
	out  by 
	{\itshape no.
	}Just how
	would the
	child know
	&quot;roughly
	where the
	negative goes&quot;
	in English if
	that child
	has not
	yet succeeded
	in even
	IDENTIFYING {\itshape not?
	}Recognition
	of the
	&quot;English position&quot;
	for Neg-placement
	depends crucially on
	the ability
	to realize
	that {\itshape not
	}(all that
	ever occurs
	in that position)
	is
	the marker
	of negation.
	Those who
	would argue
	for the
	&quot;commonsense&quot;
	explanation of
	how children
	acquire negative
	place\-ment will
	have to
	explain how
	you can
	learn what
	a form
	means and where
	it is
	placed WITHOUT
	ACTUALLY LEARNING
	THE FORM ITSELF.
	


	There is
	empirical evidence,
	too,  to 
	confirm  that 
	people  can't and
	don't learn
	in this
	way. I
	have already
	suggested some
	ways in which
	child acquisition
	is somewhat
	like decreolization:
	or, to
	put  it more precisely
	, the
	child's actuation
	of the
	bioprogram is
	like creoliza&shy;
	tion, and
	the child's
	modification of
	bioprogram specifications
	is like
	decreolization. Now,
	as  I 
	abundantly  demonstrated
	 in 
	Bickerton (1975),
	decreolization proceeds
	by acquiring
	new forms
	fust and
	new functions  
	later.<sup>9  </sup><sup>

	Another
	
	puzzle
	
	concerns
	the

	of
	{\itshape don't.
	}If

	the

	negative
	marker,
	and
	spread
	its

	In
	fact,
	{\itshape don't_
	}MUST
	be
	perceived
	
	simply
	as
	an
	alternative
	to
	{\itshape no,
	}rather
	than
	{\itshape do
	}+
	negative,
	
	since
	
	the
	child
	has
	no
	independent
	{\itshape do
	}at
	this
	stage
	or
	for
	some
	time
	to
	come.

	/58/-/62/,

	Resemblances to

	are not
	exhausted
	even wheti
	the child
	has fully
	mastered the

	reports the

	I have
	not seen
	any reports
	of sentences
	like /64/,
	but that
	in itself
	is no indication
	that they
	never occur
	in child
	language. If
	they do
	not occur, then
	the  &quot;commonsense&quot;
	 argument 
	given  above 
	could  well be
	the answer.
	If they
	do occur,
	then an
	argument based
	on the
	order of acquisition
	of negative
	indefmites cannot
	account for
	all the
	data, and  in
	light of
	the creole 
	evidence, the
	workings of
	the bioprogram
	


	must again
	be suspected.
	


	

	
	


	For our
	fourth  and  final area
	of creole
	acquisition comparison,
	we will
	look at
	the acquisition
	of causative
	constructions.
	


	First (for
	we shall
	be drawing
	evidence from
	the acquisition
	of
	


	more than
	one language
	in this
	area), we
	must bear
	in mind
	that there are
	many different
	ways of
	making the
	causative-noncausative
	dis\-tinction
	(henceforth the
	CNCD). This
	distinction may
	be marked
	on the subject
	(as in
	ergative languages)
	or on
	the verb. In
	either case,
	there may be
	several different
	types of
	marking, especially
	where verb.
	marking is
	the option
	chosen. English
	excludes subject
	marking, but marks
	the CNCD
	on the
	verb in
	several
	ways.
	


	The simplest 
	way of
	marking the
	CNCD is
	by using
	the same
	


	verb  for 
	causative  and
	noncausative  versions
	of  the 
	same  event-Le.,
	for cases
	where the
	subject must
	be the
	causative  agent
	but  also
	for cases where
	the subject
	is
	the
	patient, experiencer,
	or whatever.
	These cases are
	differentiated  only
	by transitivity 
	versus intransitivity:
	causaÂ·
	tive-agent  cases
	will have
	both  subject 
	and  object
	NP, noncausative
	


	cases will
	have only
	subject NP.
	


	

	
	


	/65/	The door
	opened.
	


	/66/	Bill opened
	the door.
	


	

	
	


	There are
	other cases
	in which
	the same
	verb is
	used for
	both causative and
	noncausative versions,
	but where
	the noncausative
	version must
	be marked
	by use
	of the
	passive:
	


	

	
	


	/67 /	*The
	tree  planted.
	


	'
	


	ACQUISITION	197
	


	

	
	


	/68/	The forester
	planted the tree.
	


	{\itshape !69!	}The
	tree was planted
	(by the
	forester).
	


	

	
	


	In yet 
	other cases,
	a different
	lexical verb
	is required 
	for causa&shy;
	tive and
	noncausative versions:
	


	

	
	


	/70/	The sheep
	{\itshape ate
	}(noncausative).
	


	/71/	John ate
	the sheep
	('f
	John caused
	the sheep
	to eat).
	


	/72/	John {\itshape fed
	
	}the
	sheep (causative).
	


	

	
	


	In a
	fourth set
	of cases,
	no appropriate
	leltical alternation
	exists, and for
	causative versions
	a periphrastic
	structure must
	be used:
	


	

	
	


	{\itshape 1731
	
	}Mary
	{\itshape suffered
	}(noncausative).
	


	{\itshape 1741
	 
	}John
	suffered
	Mary
	('f
	John
	caused
	Mary
	to
	suffer).
	


	/75/	John
	{\itshape made
	}Mary
	{\itshape suffer
	}(causative).
	


	

	
	


	Yet another
	verb-marking method,
	not used 
	by  English 
	but found, for
	example, in
	Turkish, is
	to employ
	the same
	lexical verb
	in both cases
	but differentiate
	them by
	means of
	a verbal
	affix. Ergative
	languages, too,
	generally use
	the same
	lexical verb,
	but mark
	causative subjects only
	with the 
	ergative  case-marker;
	subjects of
	noncausatives are marked,
	like objects
	of causatives,
	with the
	accusative case-marker.
	The particular
	strategy or
	selection of
	strategies chosen
	by any
	lan\-guage to
	make the
	CNCD will,
	of course,
	reflect the
	typology of
	that language. But
	the function
	of all
	of these
	varying devices
	is identical.
	


	Some methods
	of expressing
	the CNCD
	would seem
	to be
	more easily  acquired
	 than 
	others. Slobin
	(1978)
	reports a
	cross-linguistic
	experiment on
	the interpretation
	of causative
	constructions in
	which the subjects
	were child
	learners of
	English, Italian,
	Serbo-Croat, and
	Turkish. Subjects
	were required
	to act
	out with
	toy animals
	sentences such as
	{\itshape the
	horse
	made
	the
	camel
	run.
	}In
	English, Italian,
	and Serbo&shy;
	Croat, such
	sentences have
	rather similar
	structures, involving
	two disÂ·
	tinct verbs,
	one of
	them a
	lexical causative
	like {\itshape make
	}{Slobin
	did not

	include  examples 
	of  the 
	three  other 
	English  ways 
	of  marking 
	the CNCD). Turkish,
	however, uses
	single verb
	+ afftx:
	


	

	
	


	/76/	At
	deveyi kotttrsun
	


	horse-nom camel-ace
	run-causative-0ptative-3rd
	pers. (lit., the
	horse ran
	the camel)
	


	'The horse
	made the
	camel run'
	


	

	
	


	The task
	was performed
	with almost
	100
	percent accuracy
	by Turkish&shy;
	speaking children
	before the
	age of
	three. Serbo-Croat
	speakers, how&shy;
	ever, did
	not reach this
	level until
	they were
	four or
	over, while
	even at age
	four the English 
	and  Italian 
	speakers averaged
	between  only 60 and
	80 percent.
	


	This fmding
	is hardly
	surprising in
	light of
	the fact
	that the Turkish
	causative suffix
	is learned
	and used
	productively and
	correctly by the
	age of
	two-another
	of those
	cases of
	&quot;errorless
	learning&quot; we
	discussed earlier
	in this
	chapter. Equally 
	early  and
	errorless marking
	of the
	CNCD is
	reported by
	Schiefflin (1979)
	for Kaluli,
	an ergative
	language of
	Papua-New  Guinea. Here,
	the suffix
	which is
	applied to
	causative agents
	is fully
	acquired and
	appropriately used
	by age
	2:2, withont ever
	being generalized to
	nonagentive subjects.
	


	The fact that
	CNCD strategies
	that involve
	marking of
	causatives by bound
	morphemes and
	single-clause structures
	(the case
	in  both Turkish
	and Kaluli)
	are acquired
	earlier and 
	more  easily 
	than  struc&shy;
	tures involving
	two clauses
	and a
	causative verb
	casts strong
	doubts on those 
	generative-semanticist 
	analyses  that 
	would   assume  
	something like {\itshape Bill
	caused
	
	the
	door
	
	to
	become
	open
	}as the
	 underlying 
	structure of sentences
	like /66/.
	We shall
	return to
	this point
	shortly when
	we discuss the 
	treatment  by 
	Bowerman  (1974)
	 of 
	the  acquisition 
	of English
	causatives.
	


	First, however, 
	we  should 
	ask  how 
	the  cases 
	of  Turkish 
	and
	


	Kaluli relate
	to the
	creole case.
	We saw
	in Chapter
	2 that
	out of
	the six potential 
	strategies for
	expressing  the  CNCD
	described  above
	(case- .
	marking<sub>,</sub>verbal
	affixation, causal-v<sub>'</sub>erb
	periphrasis,
	passivization,
	lexical
	


	ACQUISITION<sub>	199</sub>
	


	alternation, and
	simple
	transitive-intransitive
	alternation ),
	creoles use only 
	the  last 
	named.  The 
	examples 
	given/86/-/91/, 
	Chapter   2-
	were identical
	in
	structure with
	the English
	examples in
	the present
	chapter, i.e.,
	/65/-/66/. Notoriously,
	creoles avoid
	bound-morphology solutions.
	ls it
	not then
	counterevidence to
	 the 
	language bioprogratn
	that the
	bound-morphology
	solutions of
	Turkish and
	Kaluli are
	so quickly acquired?
	


	The answer
	is: not 
	in  the
	slightest. To
	provide counterevidence
	of any
	value, one
	would have 
	to  show that 
	Turkish-type  or
	Kaluli&shy;
	type solutions
	were acquired
	BEFORE the
	simple
	transitive-intransitive alternations
	of the
	kind that
	creoles make.
	This is
	a {\itshape most
	}unlikely finding
	because, in
	fact, the
	Turkish and
	Kaluli solutions
	ARE  AL&shy;
	READY
	transitive-intransitive
	alternations which
	are simply
	under\-lined, as
	it were,
	by the
	addition
	of a
	further marker.
	Moreover, English
	causatives of
	the {\itshape door
	opened
	/Bill
	opened
	door
	}type
	are certainly
	acquired at
	an equally
	early age;
	it is
	the three
	other types
	of causative that
	create problems,
	as we
	shall see.
	


	Far from
	being counterevidence,
	 the
	Turkish  and
	Kaluli cases are
	confirmatory.
	If there
	is
	a language
	bioprogram, then
	children are
	programmed with
	a set
	of basic
	distinctions which
	 they 
	expect  that their
	native tongue
	will  implement 
	somehow.  It is
	less clear
	whether, or ..to
	what extent,
	they  are
	specifically  programmed
	 with 
	the means
	t
	realize
	these distinctions
	should their
	native  tongue 
	fail
	to meet
	their expectations
	(as is
	the case,
	most  drastically,
	 if 
	they  are
	born into a
	pidgin-speaking 
	community).  I 
	suspect  that 
	the  bioprogram
	may turn
	out as
	follows: both
	distinctions and
	means for
	implementing them ar&lt;;l
	programmed, but
	are not
	necessarily conjoint
	in the
	program. We have
	already claimed
	that the
	bioprogram  is
	not present
	at birth, but
	unfolds progressively
	 during
	the course
	of the 
	first four
	years or
	


	so; .of
	Hfe.
	The  distinctions
	 would 
	then  be 
	programmed  to 
	emerge
	


	prior to
	.two, possibly
	around eighteen
	months or
	earlier,
	while the
	m7ans  of
	implementation  would
	 not 
	necessarily  emerge
	 until
	the
	


	Â·.
	third
	or. fourth
	 year. 
	Thus,  children 
	would  start
	early  searching 
	for cme;UJs t.o
	express the
	distinction, and
	only if
	they failed
	to fmd
	any

	Put like
	this, without 
	any  supporting 
	evidence,  the 
	structure of the
	bioprogram may
	look too
	much like
	some  bizarre kind
	of provi&shy;
	dentiality, as if
	a well-meaning
	deity had
	foreseen the
	consequeces
	of European
	imperialism and
	specially equipped
	his creatures
	to circum&shy;
	vent  them. 
	However,  the 
	picture will
	change considerably
	 in
	the next
	


	Bowerman  (1974)
	 observed 
	that  from
	around  2:3
	on, but 
	more
	


	articularly arund
	the age
	of three,
	children would
	employ intransi&shy;
	t1ve
	(noncausative) verbs
	in causative
	sentences:
	


	

	
	


	<sup>{\itshape 1}</sup><sup>{\itshape 7}</sup><sup>{\itshape 7}</sup><sup>{\itshape /	}</sup>Mommy,	can you	stay this	open ?		(sc., make	this stay	open, keep this	open)		chapter, when	Ishall	discuss the
	ways in
	which the
	bioprogram may
	


	have come
	into existence.
	Creole  languages will
	 then 
	appear not 
	as a case
	of divine
	foresight and
	beneficence, but
	rather as
	the quite
	acci\-dental
	consequence of
	a much
	vaster design.
	


	As for
	those who
	claim that 
	the
	causative-noncausative 
	distinc\-tion is
	one that
	is salient
	to the
	child and
	important in
	his interaction
	with  his
	environment  (and
	therefore  easily
	learnable  from
	experience),
	


	/78/
	


	

	
	


	/79/
	


	

	
	


	/80/
	


	I'm gonna

	(sc., make
	this fall
	on her,
	drop this
	on her) She
	came it
	over there.
	


	(sc.,
	made it
	come over
	there) How
	would you
	flat it?
	


	(sc.,
	make it
	flat, flatten
	it)


	


	it does
	not follow,
	even if
	the claim
	is correct,
	that he
	can learn
	from this alone
	that the
	CNCD is
	marked in
	the language
	he is
	learning. There are
	innumerable facts
	about the
	real world
	that a
	child has learned
	by age
	two, and
	many of
	them are
	extremely important
	to him, but
	extremely few
	of them
	are explicitly
	coded in
	language. How,
	without prior
	knowledge, can
	he know
	which is
	to be
	coded and
	which is not
	? And
	this is
	without even
	considering other
	kinds of
	problems involved in
	correct learning
	of the
	various CNCD
	expressions, some
	of which
	we will
	review after
	discussing English
	acquisitions.
	


	One   of 
	the  things 
	that  facilitates 
	acquisition  of 
	Turkish  and K
	11l
	nli	i
	q  
	th:i t 
	th&quot;y  are 
	uniformÂ·  there 
	is hut 
	one way 
	to form 
	catJsatives,  and
	 the 
	morpheme involved
	is unique
	and undergoes
	only  
	phonologically-conditioned	forms 
	of  variation. 
	The  picture 
	in English, with 
	its  four
	ways of
	expressing the
	CNCD, is
	at an
	op.posite
	extreme. Since
	conflicting evidence
	is not
	much better
	than no
	evidence at  all,
	the  theory
	 would 
	predict  that
	English learners
	would  treat
	En\-glish, in
	this respect,
	just as
	creole children
	treat a
	pidgin; that
	is,.having failed  to
	 extract 
	from  their 
	input  a 
	consistent  way 
	of expressmg 
	the CNCD,  they would
	generalize the
	simplest
	transitive-versus-intransitive solution, 
	already  available
	 to 
	them  from 
	{\itshape open-ty
	pe 
	}verbs,  to
	 other classes
	of verbs.
	And this
	is, in
	fact, exactly
	what they
	do.
	


	Note  that 
	this  creative 
	process  extends 
	to  adjectives 
	as well 
	as verbs
	


	{\itshape (/
	Of),
	}and
	that the
	line between
	adjectives and
	verbs may
	therefore, at
	this stage,
	be as
	thin as
	it is
	in creoles.
	


	.     This
	process does
	not limit
	itself to
	intransitives. Transitive
	verbs hke {\itshape eat
	}which are
	restricted to
	noncausative meanings
	(see /70/,
	/71/
	abve)
	and hence,
	except where
	cannibalism  is
	practised, to
	nonhuman objects are
	also treated
	as if
	they were
	potential causatives:
	


	

	
	


	/81/	Child
	(pretending to
	feed doll)
	: See,
	she can't
	eat!
	


	Mother: Just
	pretend, honey.
	Child: But
	Ican't
	eat h
	er!
	


	(sc., make
	her eat,
	feed her
	)
	



	
	


	. .Clark
	and Clark
	(1977:511), in
	discussing these
	developments, explicitly
	compare them
	with the
	child's
	over-generalization of
	regular plural forms.
	Ideed,
	what is
	.significant 
	about these
	cases is
	precisely that they
	constitute a
	generalization to
	English of
	the regular
	creole strategy. But
	a good
	deal more
	is involved
	than that.
	


	

	
	


	&quot;  Let	s	ppose
	that children
	learn language
	by adopting
	a series
	of	strategies  ;
	whether learned 
	or innate
	is immaterial 
	here.  Such























	


	<sub>202	</sub>ROOTS
	OF

	strategies would
	clearly include
	generalization, one
	of the
	best-attested concomitants
	of acquisition.
	The strategy
	of generalization
	might be
	informally defined
	as
	follows:
	


	

	
	


	Step 1:
	Look for
	any regular
	form with
	a consistent
	core of meaning.
	


	Step 2:
	Apply that
	form in
	all possible
	environments.
	


	Step 3:
	Compare output
	with input,
	and note
	cases (if
	any) where these
	do not match.
	


	Step 4:
	Remove the
	exceptions (if
	any) which 
	appear  when Step
	3
	is applied.
	


	

	
	


	This strategy would
	be applied
	in a
	wide variety  of
	cases: in English
	pluralization, past
	tense, and,
	again, in
	causatives. The
	child would
	note the
	existence of
	a number
	of pairs
	like X
	{\itshape opened
	/Y
	opened
	}X (Step
	1); he
	would generalize
	this, yielding
	pairs like
	X {\itshape ate/
	Y
	ate
	}X (Step
	2); he
	would note
	counterevidence such
	 as 
	{\itshape Y
	fed
	
	}X (Step
	3) ; he
	would  then 
	gradually  substitute
	 &quot;irregular&quot;
	 forms 
	like  {\itshape Y
	 fed 
	}X
	for false
	&quot;regular&quot;
	forms like
	{\itshape Y
	ate
	}X (Step
	4 ).
	


	Let us
	suppose that
	the Kaluli
	learner applied
	a similar
	strategy. He
	would fast
	observe that
	a
	number of
	nouns in
	subject position
	had an ergative
	affix
	(Step 1);
	he would
	then generalize
	the affix
	to all
	NPs in
	subject position
	(Step 2);
	he would
	then note
	that in
	fact a
	number of subjects
	had a
	different kind
	of affix
	(Step 3);
	he would
	then work toward
	a correct
	distribution of
	the ergative
	and accusative
	affo&lt;:es (Step 4).
	


	Unfortw1ately,
	while the
	generalization strategy
	provides an
	exact description
	of what
	English learners
	do about
	causative marking,
	it provides
	a completely
	inaccurate description
	of what
	Kaluli learners do
	about their
	causative marking.
	If Kaluli
	learners applied
	the same strategy,
	then we
	should find
	large numbers
	of ergative
	case-markers applied to
	experiencer or
	patient subjects
	which, according
	to Schief&shy;
	flin, we
	do not
	do. Why
	is the
	generalization strategy
	chosen in
	one case, but
	not in
	the other?	<sub>\</sub>
	


	ACQUISffION<sub>	</sub><sub>2</sub><sub>0</sub><sub>3</sub>		A simplistic	answer might	be: because	the two	cases are	not really comparable.	In Kaluli,	there is	a semantic	and pragmatic	distinc\-tion between	subjects that	cause things	to happen	and subjects
	that do not.
	In English,
	no such
	distinction is
	involved. The
	sets of
	verbs that take
	simple
	transitive-intransitive
	alternation, as
	opposed to those
	that take
	lexical alternation,
	passivization, or
	causal-verb periphrasis,
	is
	not a
	natural semantic
	class; nothing
	but experience
	could tell
	one that
	{\itshape the
	jock.ey
	wal.ked
	th:
	horse
	}and {\itshape the
	jockey
	galloped
	the
	horse
	}are gram&shy;
	matical, but 
	{\itshape *the;ockey
	ran
	the
	horse
	}is
	not.
	


	It is
	true that
	the two
	cases are
	not  comparable 
	from the
	stand\-point  of
	 an 
	adult  who 
	knows something
	of the
	grammar of
	both lan&shy;
	guages-but  from 
	the  CHILD's
	viewpoint?  How 
	is
	the child 
	supposed to
	recognize that
	semantic sets
	are involved
	in one
	case, but
	not in
	the other,  unless
	 he 
	already  knows 
	what  the 
	relevant  semantic
	 sets
	are? He  cannot 
	construct  semantic
	sets from
	experience alone
	until he
	has at leat
	eperienced
	 the 
	full_range
	 of
	semantic classes
	that the
	language contruns
	(1f
	then!).
	Each lexical
	item has
	so many
	parameters of
	mean\-ing,
	could fit
	into so
	many partially
	overlapping classes,
	that one
	could never say
	for certain,
	given any
	body  of partial
	data, whether
	semantic lasses did
	or did
	not  coincide
	with  the 
	formal differences
	perceptible m  those
	 data. 
	But  production 
	does  not 
	stand  still
	until the
	child has
	master:d	possible
	semantic classes
	in the
	language confronting
	him. The
	child 1s
	under pressure
	to talk,
	whether he
	is ready
	or not.
	


	If  the
	child formed 
	hypotheses,  as
	so many
	suppose, then
	there woul be 
	many  different 
	hypotheses  that 
	the  Kaluli
	child might
	make. He .might
	assume that
	ergative and
	accusative case-markers
	are merely sub3ect
	 markers 
	that  happened 
	to  be 
	in  free 
	variation   or 
	that  the ergative
	 :&quot;.arker
	m:irked  subjects 
	that  happened 
	also  to 'be 
	topics,  or that
	sta.t1v1ty
	was mvolved 
	somehow  (since
	many  causatives are
	non\-statives,
	while.many statives
	are noncausatives,
	this hypothesis
	might be a
	very.attractive
	 one). 
	But  wrong 
	choices of

	this does

	that here
	the child's
	task is
	made more
	complex by
	the fact
	that the causative
	marker is
	only one
	of a
	string of
	verbal suffixes
	which fre&shy;
	quently co-occur:
	suffixes which
	indicate reciprocity,
	negation, person,
	number,  tense, 
	and  the 
	direct/indirect 
	knowledge  distinction
	 which, as
	we saw
	above, is
	the only
	one that
	seems to
	cause problems.
	These strings of
	suffixes present
	two quite
	distinct kinds
	of problems. 
	The first is
	a problem
	of segmentation,
	which the
	child presumably 
	solves by some
	kind  of 
	substitution-in-frame 
	process.  The 
	second-figuring out
	what each
	of the
	suffixes means,
	once they
	have been
	segmented\-is less
	often considered,
	perhaps because 
	it
	looks easy
	to  the 
	adult, who can
	&quot;look
	in the
	back of
	the book,&quot; 
	so to 
	speak. In 
	fact,  it  is much
	more difficult
	than the
	first, and
	the fact
	that speech
	to
	children is
	strongly oriented
	toward the
	here-and-now, often
	urged as
	a reason why
	children do not
	need  an
	innate component,
	in reality
	makes the task 
	harder  rather 
	than  easier;
	every  situational
	 context 
	is composed of
	innumerable factors,
	any of
	which, for
	all the
	child is
	supposed to know,
	could be
	directly reflected
	in linguistic
	structure,
	and sets
	of context
	ual features
	are seldom
	constant from
	one situation
	to another. The
	child who
	tried to
	figure
	out which
	semantic factors
	were marked
	grammatically- assuming
	that a
	two-year-old mind
	would be
	remotely capable of
	this, even
	at an
	unconscious level-would
	be in
	the position
	of someone
	who tries
	to solve
	a maze
	problem; he
	would have
	to take the
	most promising-looking
	path, pursue
	it until
	it was
	blocked, then
	retrace his
	steps to
	the beginning
	again and
	repeat the
	process.  But when
	we consider
	that the
	same semantic
	factors are
	marked gram&shy;
	matically over
	and  over again 
	across the
	range of
	human languages,
	that in
	effect languages
	select out
	of a
	very short 
	list  of 
	semantic primes the
	ones that
	they are
	going to
	mark, much
	as they
	select their
	phonological inventory
	from the
	set of
	distinctive features,
	it becomes more
	reasonable to
	assume that
	the child
	has advance
	knowledge of
	the
	


	contents  of 
	the  category 
	&quot;grammatically-markable  
	semantic  feature.&quot;
	Thus,  both 
	a  &quot;strategies&quot;
	approach  and 
	a &quot;hypothesis-forming&quot;
	


	approach  fail
	to  account
	 for 
	the  learning 
	of  the 
	CNCD in
	English,
	


	Turkish, and
	Kaluli. A
	&quot;strategic'\'
	approach fails
	to explain
	why the
	


	ACQUISITION<sub>	205</sub>
	


	child over-generalizes
	in
	the case
	of English
	causatives but
	not in
	the case of
	Kaluli causatives-unless
	it introduces
	some &quot;hyperstrategic&quot;
	device which
	would tell
	the child
	which strategy to
	use inwhich
	case.11 A
	&quot;hypothesis-forming&quot;
	approach  fails because
	it
	cannot show
	how, out of
	a wide
	range of
	hypotheses that
	the child
	could form
	about the nature
	of Turkish
	and K.aluli
	morphemes, that
	child invariably
	picks the correct
	one the
	first time
	around. A
	language-bioprogram
	approach is able
	to deal
	with both
	problems. It
	has no
	strategies, so
	the first problem
	is a
	ghost problem.
	It
	specifies
	the set
	of distinctions
	to be
	marked, so the
	second problem
	does not
	arise.
	


	

	
	


	However, before
	leaving causatives
	we should
	consider an
	obser\-vation made
	 in 
	Bowerman  (1974)
	that  while 
	&quot;correct&quot;
	causatives  like
	{\itshape Mornmy  
	open 
	door 
	}are  acquired
	 before 
	periphrastic  causatives
	 like {\itshape Billy
	
	mtike
	me
	cry,
	}&quot;incorrect&quot;
	causatives  do
	not  appear
	until AFTER the
	emergence of
	correct {\itshape mtik
	e
	}sentences.
	From these
	facts, Bowerman
	argued  (and
	the argument
	sounded a
	lot better
	in the
	days when
	genera\-tive
	semantics was
	still alive)
	that although 
	the child
	at an
	early stage might 
	PRODUCE  sentences
	 like 
	{\itshape Mommy 
	open 
	door, 
	}he  would
	 not yet
	be &lt;ible
	to &quot;break
	down&quot; such
	sentences into 
	&quot;a
	cause proposition
	and  an 
	effect   proposition.&quot; 
	However,   once 
	he  had 
	acquired  {\itshape make
	}sentences,
	which  do
	formally  divide 
	the  sentence 
	into  these 
	proposi\-tions,  he
	 could 
	then  analyze 
	sentences  with 
	{\itshape open, 
	}etc.,  in
	 just 
	the sam.e way;
	and, once
	this reanalysis
	was complete,
	it could
	be general&shy;
	


	Â·ized. to
	both transitive
	and intransitive
	causatives, as
	we saw
	in examples
	


	/77/'/81/.

	Slobin found
	that even
	at age
	four, English
	learners often
	could not act out
	{\itshape make-X
	-do-Y
	}sentences correctly,
	which suggests
	that even
	at that age,
	they understood
	them only
	imperfectly. If
	this is
	the case,
	then it is
	hardly likely that
	children a
	little over
	two  could 
	understand them
	structurally in
	the way
	that Bowerman
	claims. Of
	course, Bower&shy;
	man could
	not be
	expected to
	foresee Slobin's
	results, but
	she assumes
	that children
	understand {\itshape make
	}sentences
	on the
	basis of
	no evidence
	whatsoever.
	


	Let  us 
	suppose  that 
	children  could 
	analyze  sentences
	 as 
	she . suggests. 
	In  that 
	case, why 
	do  they 
	not  generalize 
	{\itshape make-X-do-Y
	
	}to newly 
	acquired  noncausatives,
	 instead 
	of  going 
	back  to 
	{\itshape X-open-Y
	}and 
	generalizing  that?
	 If 
	they  took 
	this  surely 
	very  plausible 
	step, they  would 
	produce  perfectly
	  grammatical   sentences
	 like 
	{\itshape can
	
	you
	mak
	e
	this
	stay
	open?,
	I'm
	gonna
	make
	this
	fall
	
	on
	you,
	}etc.,
	in place
	of  the 
	ungrammatical  
	/77/-/81/.  The 
	fact  that 
	they  do
	not  do
	
	this, viewed
	in light
	of Slobin's
	results, suggests
	that the
	earliest periphrastic
	{\itshape make
	
	}causatives 
	are acquired 
	as idiomatic 
	chunks which 
	are  not 
	yet analyzed  and
	therefore not
	yet  generalizable.  If
	they are
	not analyzed,
	their analysis 
	cannot  be
	what  triggers
	the spread
	of incorrect 
	{\itshape or&gt;et1-
	}type 
	causatives.  Bowetman's
	 argument 
	is simply 
	the  logical
	


	{\itshape post
	hoe,
	ergo
	propter
	hoe.}
	


	. As
	for the
	alleged delay
	in the
	appearance of
	incorrect {\itshape open&shy;
	}type
	causatives, this
	could be
	due to
	nothing more
	complex than
	the interaction of
	communicative need
	with available
	vocabulary. As
	long as the
	child can
	handle his
	needs with
	a relatively
	small vocabulary,
	the need
	to &quot;invent&quot;
	new causatives
	simply will
	not arise.
	But when the
	number of
	things he
	wants to
	(and potentially
	can) say is
	expanding more rapidly
	than his
	vocabulary. which
	is the
	case as
	he gets
	deeper into his
	third year,
	he will
	need to
	express concepts
	like those
	expressed by {\itshape drop,
	flatten,
	}etc.,
	before he
	has had
	the opportunity
	to acquire the
	appropriate lexical
	items. And
	it is from
	this period,
	say 2:
	6 to
	3:3,
	that most
	of Bowerman's
	examples are
	drawn.
	


	

	
	


	We have
	now reviewed
	a &quot;{ide
	range of
	evidence, dealing
	with the
	


	ACQUISITION<sub>	</sub><sub>2</sub><sub>0</sub><sub>7</sub>		acquisition of	a number	of widely	different features	in several	different languages,	which cannot	easily, if	at all,	be accounted	for by	existing theories of	language acquisition,	but which	follow naturally
	if  we assume
	the existence
	of an
	innate bioprogram
	for language.
	Moreover, the view
	of acquisition
	which this
	assumption provides
	is
	more satis&shy;
	factory on
	a commonsense 
	level.  Hitherto, 
	we  have 
	had  to 
	assume that small
	creatures who
	could barely
	control their
	own bowel
	move\-ments were
	capable of
	learning things-whether
	you choose
	to call
	them &quot;rules&quot;
	or &quot;behavior&quot;
	is quite
	irrelevant at
	this level-of
	such abstract&shy;
	ness and
	complexity that
	when brought
	to the
	level of
	consciousness, mature
	scholars often
	misanalyze them.
	This  paradox 
	was  not 
	very often alluded
	to, but
	of course
	it was
	always there 
	whether  it 
	was alluded to
	or not.
	Now we
	can see
	that children
	can only
	learn language
	because, in
	effect, they
	already know
	a language.
	


	Interestingly enough,
	a similar
	view was
	arrived at
	by Fodor (1975),
	arguing in
	a completely
	different way
	from a
	completely different
	starting point.
	According to
	Fodor, it
	is
	not just
	common sense improbable,
	it is
	logically impossible
	for anyone
	to learn
	a lan\-guage
	unless
	he already
	knows a
	language. &quot;Learning
	a language
	(includ\-ing,
	of course,
	a fast
	language) involves
	learning what
	the predicates
	of the
	language mean.
	Learning what
	the predicates
	of a
	language mean
	involves learning
	a determination
	of the
	extension of
	these predicates.
	Learning a
	determination of
	the extensions
	of the
	predicates involves
	learning that
	they fall
	under certain
	rules (i.e.,
	truth rules).
	But one
	cannot learn
	that (P)redicate
	falls under
	(R)ule unless
	one has
	a lan\-guage
	in which
	P and
	R can
	be represented.
	So one
	cannot learn
	a language unless
	one has
	a language&quot;
	(Fodor 1975:63-64).
	


	Thus, to
	give a
	concrete example
	from the
	first case
	we looked at
	in this
	chapter, a
	child cannot
	know which
	members of
	the class
	


	{\itshape a.
	NP
	}are
	specific and
	which are
	nonspecific
	unless he
	knows what
	specific and
	nonspecific mean,
	and he
	cannot know
	what they
	mean unless he
	has, in
	some sense,
	a language
	in which
	that meaning is
	some\-how
	represented.  As
	
	to how  it
	
	might  be
	represented, that
	must be
	


	.reserved for
	the next
	chapter.

	be supported
	by the
	large body
	of empirical
	evidence surveyed
	in the
	preceding
	chapters-evidence arrived
	at by
	methods totally 
	different  fi:om
	 Fodor's
	and, at
	the time
	of gathering,
	in total
	ignorance of
	his claims.
	When two
	such dissimilar
	approaches
	


	agree  so 
	completely  in 
	their  results, 
	neither  coincidence
	 nor
	{\itshape Jolie
	
	a}
	


	{\itshape deux
	}provides a
	convincing explanation.
	


	However, there
	is tremendous
	emotional resistance
	to the
	idea that language
	is innate,
	some of
	the reasons
	for which
	I would
	like to glance
	at briefly
	in Chapter
	5. In
	part, this
	emotional resistance
	is rationalized by
	some curious
	ideas about
	what is
	entailed in
	the making of
	innatist claims.
	Typical are
	the following:
	



	
	


	It
	is not
	very helpful,
	however, to
	stop with
	the conclu&shy;
	sion that
	linguistic universals
	spring from
	innate predisposi&shy;
	tions (Clark
	and Clark
	1977
	:517).
	  Â·
	


	

	
	


	. ..
	to assume
	that deep
	structures are
	&quot;innate&quot; makes
	a postulate
	out of
	a problem and
	this in
	itself means
	that all further
	study can
	lead us
	nowhere (Luria
	1975:383).
	


	

	
	


	Similarly, I
	am quite
	certain that
	many students
	of acquisition
	who have
	read this
	far will
	at the
	moment of
	reaching this
	very para&shy;
	graph be
	thinking something
	along the
	following lines:
	&quot;Sure, he
	says that the
	problems of
	accounting for
	acquisition are
	much simpler
	if you assume
	an innate
	bioprogram. Of
	course they
	are; you
	can simply avoid
	them by
	making a
	completely untestable
	claim. Everybody
	knows that children
	lern;
	the real
	job is
	finding out
	how they
	do it,
	and he's
	


	just shirking
	that.&quot;
	


	ACQUISITION<sub>	</sub><sub>2</sub><sub>0</sub><sub>9</sub>		There are	so many	replies	to this,	one hardly	knows  where 	to start.	Let me	begin by	saying that	students of	acquisition have	shirked	

	two tasks,
	not just
	one: the
	task of
	accounting for
	how creoles
	were learned, and
	the task
	of accounting
	fof how
	the ftrst
	human language,
	whatever that
	was, was
	learned. If
	they think
	that these
	two tasks
	are somehow  different
	in
	kind  from,
	or irrelevant 
	to, the
	processes  of
	


	&quot;normal&quot; language
	acquisition, the
	onus is
	now. squarely
	on them
	to prove this.
	


	Next, nobody
	is denying
	that children
	learn. Children
	learning English learn
	the difference
	between English
	and the
	bioprogram language, and
	I am
	sure that
	they use
	a whole
	battery of
	learning strategies,
	inductive processes,
	etc.,
	in the
	course of
	doing this.
	Students of
	learning in
	the traditional
	sense need
	have no
	fears that
	the rug
	will be pulled
	out from
	under them;
	their field
	is still
	ample, and,
	if narÂ· rower,
	at least
	better defined
	than before.
	


	All that
	is
	threatened
	is
	the
	assumption underlying
	their attitude:
	that language
	cannot  be 
	innate. This
	is in
	fact an
	a priori
	assumption for which
	the only
	evidence ever
	advanced is
	the ostrich-like
	pooh\-poohing
	typified by
	Luria's
	comment. What
	is more,
	it is
	an inherently
	improbable assumption
	in view
	of the
	fact that
	the vast
	majority of
	hehavior by
	animate creatures,
	especially behavior
	as crucial
	to a species
	as language
	is to
	ours, is
	biologically programmed.
	To suppose that 
	language  is
	not is
	against the
	balance of
	the evidence
	and a
	mere
	


	piece of
	species arrogance,
	as I
	am sure
	any Martian
	arbiter (if
	only there {\itshape were
	}Martians!)
	would quickly
	agree.
	


	If indeed
	language is
	innate, then
	to continue
	looking for
	ways in. which 
	it could
	be learned
	from experience
	makes about
	as much sense
	as dropping
	your keys
	on the
	left-hand side
	of the
	road and then
	looking for
	them on
	the right-hand
	side because
	there aren't
	any streetlamps.
	on the
	leftÂ·hand
	side.
	Further, the
	claim that
	the theory is
	untestable, like
	the claim
	that innateness
	represents a
	necessary terminus for
	research, is
	simply untrue.

	210	ROOTS
	OF
	LANGUAGE
	


	

	
	


	Inthe
	course of
	the present
	chapter Ihave
	mentioned specifically
	a number
	of predictions
	which the
	theory makes
	about acquisition
	processes; these
	should be
	easily testable
	by
	reference to
	primary data.
	Moreover, acquisition
	has yet
	to be
	studied in
	the vast
	majority of human
	languages. All
	of them
	should show
	reflexes of
	the bioprogram
	features claimed
	in this
	chapter, although
	clearly those
	reflexes will
	differ from
	language to
	language since
	we cannot
	study
	the activity
	of the
	bioprogram directly,
	but only
	its interaction
	with  particular
	target languages.
	Thus, the
	evidence available
	will not
	always be
	clear, and its
	interpretation will
	be more
	often than
	not a
	matter of
	legiti\-mate
	controversy; but
	nobody can
	claim that
	such evidence
	is either scarce
	or hard
	to obtain.
	The fact
	that I
	have been
	able to
	derive so much
	evidence from
	works whose
	authors were
	not even
	looking for
	phenomena crucial
	to the
	present theory
	lends further
	support to
	the claim that
	evidence will
	be plentiful;
	if even
	the crude
	plow of
	the pi0neer throws
	up nuggets,
	there can
	be little
	doubt that
	the trained
	prospector following
	on his
	heels will
	fmd many
	more.
	


	Moreover, there
	are other
	ways in.
	which the
	theory  can 
	be tested. One
	is by
	a study
	of the
	present-day acquisition
	of creole
	languages, a
	study which 
	has  yet 
	to  be 
	carried out.
	Although  creoles
	are nowadays
	acquired in
	just the
	same way
	as other
	languages, the
	nature of
	their origins
	ought to
	mean that
	they are
	acquired with
	far fewer mistakes
	on the
	part  of
	the children,
	and in
	a far
	shorter period

	if differences
	in time span 
	and/or  quantity 
	of  error 
	do  indeed  exist,
	they  can
	give them a
	reasonably  accurate
	 statistical
	measurement. Of
	course, the
	results
	


	will be
	more meaningful
	the more
	that creoles
	relatively free
	of super
	. strate influence,
	which have
	remained relatively
	unchanged since
	their origin, are
	made the
	subject of
	study. Little
	value would
	be obtained from
	a study
	of HCE
	acquisition, for
	example, given
	the rising
	tide of English
	that is
	presently eroding
	it
	,
	and the
	fact that
	in its
	purest forn1,
	it is
	spoken only
	by a
	minority of
	the population,
	few if
	any of
	wholllf are now
	under forty-five.
	


	ACQUISITION<sub>	211</sub>
	


	Eventully, of  
	curse, empirical
	testing of the
	theory will
	depend on
	advances m
	the field
	of neurology,
	since whatever
	is innate
	must have  n	bjective
	physical foundation
	in the
	structure and/or
	mode of funct10ng
	 of 
	the  human 
	brain.  Indeed, 
	linguists  are 
	all  too 
	often oefull 
	ignort
	of  this 
	field. For 
	example,  Alleyne 
	( 1979)
	writes: There
	is nothmg
	{\itshape readily
	apparent
	}in the
	neurological and
	cognitive sysems of
	humans  that 
	makes it
	natural or
	inevitable&quot; that
	the cate&shy;
	gories I	ave proposed
	for TMA
	systems should
	be the
	appropriate ones
	


	(empha.s1s
	added). The
	expectation that
	the appropriateness
	of semantic
	c.ategones
	should be
	&quot;readily apparent&quot;
	in our
	neurological and
	cogni\-tive  systems
	 would 
	appear  to 
	presuppose  a 
	human  brain 
	charted labeled, and
	numbered like
	the old-time
	phrenologist's diagrams.
	We ar: ower'e
	nea: that
	stage yet;
	if we
	get there,
	it will be
	due in
	part to
	the lmu:st
	s tlhng
	the neurologist
	some things
	to look
	for, and
	the neurol-
	


	0?1st
	s .telling 
	the  linguist 
	whether  what 
	he has
	found  confirms 
	or disconfirms what
	the linguist
	predicted.
	


	Remarks like
	those of
	Luria or
	Clark and
	Clark cited
	above seem o  
	nvision the
	linguist as
	some kind
	of bucolic
	sheriff, shaking
	his fist impotence
	 because 
	the  perpetrator 
	has just  
	fled  across
	the county hne.
	So what
	if w
	hae 
	o go
	learn neurology
	? So what
	if
	neurologists hve
	to g
	learn ln;i.gmstics?
	 We
	are boring 
	the same
	mountain  from
	different  sides,
	and  the idea
	that  innateness 
	spells scholarly 
	impotence
	


	reflects only
	the lack
	of imagination
	of those
	who entertain
	it.
	


	.	We  have 
	not  even 
	yet  exhausted 
	the remedies 
	available  to  us
	t1Â¥11t;
	h.ere
	 and
	now.  There  is a
	diachronic  aspect
	 to
	the whole 
	issue w111.ch
	
	has not 
	yet  been 
	appreciated. The
	bioprogram  itself
	must  have  a history
	 and
	an origin,
	and that
	history  and
	origin  cannot
	lie beyond all 
	tracing.  It 
	is  true 
	that  the 
	attempt  to
	trace  them
	will kad 
	us into what	s
	proved  a 
	veritable  Sargasso
	 Sea 
	of theories: 
	glottogenesis, the ong1
	of human
	language. But
	we will
	have at
	least one
	advantage over
	earher  voyagers. 
	We will
	be equipped
	with a

	 that

	In the
	next chapter,
	accordingly,  we
	will attempt
	 to
	reconstruct the
	prehistory  and
	early history
	of human
	language, in
	order to
	deter\-mine, if
	at all

	might be

	 consequences 
	the  first 
	three  chapters 
	have  explored, In
	particular,  we
	will try
	to suggest
	specific bases
	for
	a least
	some of those
	semantic distinctions
	which, as the
	present chapter
	has suggested;

	and quite
	unavoidably, we
	must take
	off for
	a more
	speculative realm.
	And yet
	in that
	realm, we
	must never
	lose sight
	of the
	fact that
	there is at
	least one
	thing there
	that is
	as certain
	as
	death or
	taxes. Even
	if it could

	that natural

	that creoles
	are learned,
	it cannot
	be shown
	that the

	was learned-for

	could not
	have been 
	learned. Even jf

	Hill and
	Most [1978]
	) is
	really beside
	the point.
	Either this
	gestural language was
	of a
	structure as
	complex and
	noniconic as
	modern sign-in
	which case
	the real
	question would
	be, how
	did this
	gestural language
	develop?-or
	it was
	some much
	simpler and
	more iconic system-in
	which case
	the real
	question would
	be, how
	did it
	get to
	be more
	abstract and
	complex? In
	fact, the
	&quot;gestural-origins&quot;
	theory is just
	as much
	focused on
	the supposed
	&quot;critical point&quot;
	of language
	development, and
	just as
	indifferent to
	any of
	the substantive
	questions about language
	origins as
	any of
	the other
	&quot;Flintstone&quot;
	theories.
	


	The trouble
	with almost
	all previous
	attempts to
	look at
	origins is that
	they do
	not go
	back far
	enough. If we
	were to
	understand thoroughly all
	that  language 
	involved,  we 
	would  probably 
	have  to go
	back to
	the birth
	of the
	lowliest animate
	creat ures,
	for language
	depends crucially
	on a
	matrix of
	volition and
	primitive consciousness
	which must
	have begun
	to be
	laid down
	hundreds of
	millions of
	years ago. Such
	an approach
	lies far
	beyond the
	scope of
	the present
	volume, and will
	be addressed
	in a
	subsequent work,
	{\itshape Language
	and
	Species.
	}Here, I
	shall go
	back no
	further than,
	say, {\itshape Dryopithecus,
	}although
	a brief glance
	at the
	frog will
	not hurt
	us.
	


	Again ,
	as in
	previous chapters,
	a certain
	amount of
	ground\-clearing work
	must be 
	done if
	we are
	to avoid
	irrelevant distractions.
	At the
	very least,
	we will
	have to
	dispose of
	what I
	shall call
	the Para\-dox
	of Continuity.
	


	The Paradox of
	Continuity is,
	at  the 
	present  moment, 
	perhaps the greatest
	 obstacle 
	to  a 
	proper  understanding
	 of
	language  origins,
	as well
	as a
	powerful factor
	in keeping
	linguistics isolated
	from other human
	studies. It
	may be
	expressed as
	follows. On
	the one
	hand, all the
	species-specific adaptive
	developments that
	we know
	of have
	come about through
	regular evolutionary
	processes, and
	language, remarkable
	though it may
	be, is
	only one  such
	development; therefore,
	language must have
	evolved out 
	of prior 
	mammalian  communication
	 systems. On the
	other hand,
	if one
	has anything
	like a
	complete understanding
	of what
	language is
	and does,
	one realizes
	that there
	is not
	simply a
	quantitative,  but 
	a qualitative 
	and indeed 
	unbridgeable,  gulf
	between
	


	'
	


	ORIGINS	217
	


	

	
	


	the abstractions
	and complexities
	of language
	and the
	most abstract and
	complex of
	known mammalian
	systems (which,
	indeed, seem
	pretty direct
	and simple);
	therefore, language
	cannot  have evolved
	out of
	prior  mammalian
	communication systems.
	Thus, there
	must have been
	evolutionary continuity
	in the
	development of
	language, yet there
	cannot have
	been evolutionary
	continuity in
	the development
	of language.
	This is
	the Paradox
	of Continuity,
	and debate
	on it
	has followed the
	approved political
	model of
	both sides
	hurling slogans
	at one another
	from their
	different and,
	as we
	shall see,
	mutually irrele\-vant
	positions.
	


	

	
	


	All paradoxes
	that are
	resolvable are
	resolved by 
	showing that one
	or more
	of the
	presuppositions on
	which they
	are based
	is incorrect or
	at best
	misleadingly stated.
	In the
	present case,
	both sides
	of the paradox
	have weak
	legs. The
	weak leg
	of the
	discontinuity side
	is a belief
	in the
	unitary nature
	of language;
	the weak
	leg of
	the continuity
	side is
	the belief
	that if
	language evolved
	out of
	anything, it
	must have evolved
	out  of 
	another  communication
	 system. 
	Let  us 
	examine  each of
	these in
	turn.
	


	The belief
	that language
	is one
	and  indissoluble 
	has also
	taken its toll
	on the
	primate-experiment
	debate.  In 
	both  areas, 
	the  central point
	of debate
	has been
	&quot;When can
	X be
	said to
	have language?&quot;&shy;
	&quot;language&quot; being
	defined, by
	the discontinuity
	side, as
	something virtually
	indistinguishable from
	Modern English
	or Ancient
	(ancient!) Greek.
	Although the
	continuity side
	may have
	protested the
	definition, few have
	protested the
	gambit; instead
	of pointing
	out that
	the ques\-tion
	&quot;Has X
	got language
	or hasn't
	he?&quot; is
	an intrinsically
	stupid, irrelevant, and
	 actively misleading
	question, they
	have mostly
	con\-tented 
	themselves  with 
	trying  to  get
	linguists to
	lower the
	target  (for a
	generally bracing
	and insightful,
	if overly
	soft on
	the continuity
	side, account of
	the ape
	debate, see
	Linden  1974
	).
	


	In fact,
	we will
	get  nowhere 
	until  we 
	appreciate that 
	anything as complex
	as language
	cannot possibly
	be an
	internally undifferenti&shy;
	ated  object, but
	rather must
	consist of
	a number
	of interacting
	systems,

	some of
	which may
	originally have
	developed for
	other purposes
	and many, perhaps
	all, of
	which must
	have developed
	at different
	times and under
	different circumstances.
	Once we
	accept this,
	we can
	per\-ceive the
	development of
	language as
	a succession
	of stages
	and there&shy;
	fore amenable
	to reconstruction
	and study,
	rather than
	as a
	quantum leap, which
	then imposes
	on us,
	whether we
	will or
	no, some
	kirid of
	catastrophe theory
	as the
	only possible
	origins story.
	It then
	becomes possible to
	replace &quot;Has
	X got
	language or
	hasn't he?&quot;
	with the
	more interesting, and
	more answerable
	question, &quot;How
	far  has X 
	come along the
	road to
	language-specifically,
	which of
	the necessary
	pre\-requisites
	does he
	have, and
	which does
	he still
	lack?&quot;
	


	In the
	opposite camp,
	the belief
	that language
	must have
	evolved from some
	prior communicative
	system if
	it evolved
	at all
	is clearly
	connected with
	the belief
	that language
	is only,
	or originally,
	or pri&shy;
	marily, a
	communicative system.
	Any doubt
	cast on
	this is
	enough to send
	the continuity
	side into
	a flurry
	of pooh-poohing.
	Typical is
	the attitude  of 
	Young  (1978:175),
	who  finds
	it &quot;a
	further {\itshape problem&quot;
	
	}that &quot;a
	major  use 
	of language 
	in  each 
	of us
	is internal-for
	thinking, that
	is {\itshape for
	speaking
	to
	ourselves,&quot;
	}but
	nevertheless concludes
	that  it 
	is {\itshape &quot;rather
	perverse 
	}not  to
	 consider 
	human  spoken  or
	written language
	as primarily
	a functional
	system evolved
	for communication&quot;
	(emphasis added). Perhaps
	a biologist
	may be
	forgiven for
	not realizing
	that language is
	not just
	&quot;for communication&quot;
	but is
	also that
	which is com&shy;
	municated. But
	in fact
	the belief
	is widespread
	that all
	language in&shy;
	volved  was
	giving labels 
	to  things 
	and  stringing 
	the labels
	together. It is
	assumed as
	self-evident that
	when we
	were ready
	to talk,
	all the things
	in the
	universe stood
	there waiting-rock
	and river,
	dodo and
	elephant, storm
	and sunrise,
	thirst and
	evil, love
	and dishonor-all
	waiting  patiently  for
	their  labels.
	That  the
	world had
	to be
	recreated in the
	image of
	language before
	anyone could
	communicate about
	any\-thing at
	all is
	an idea
	that seems
	simply not
	to have
	occurred on
	the continuity side.
	How that
	recreation was
	carried out
	will form
	an essential part
	of the
	analysis that
	follows.
	


	Crucial  to 
	extant  continuity
	 models, 
	even  the  most 
	recent,  is
	


	'
	


	ORIGINS	219
	


	

	
	


	the belief,
	whether implicit
	or explicit,
	that you
	could get
	from a
	call system to
	modern language
	(with or
	without an
	intermediate stop
	at a gestural
	system) by
	a series
	of imperceptible
	stages. Thus,
	Stephenson (1979)
	proposes a
	&quot;dialectical&quot;
	evolutionary process
	by which,
	when our
	ancestors were
	more preyed
	upon than
	preying, they
	learned to control
	involuntary vocalizations
	and replace
	them with
	manual signs (how
	a four-foot
	hominid in
	five-foot grass
	informs his
	cohorts of the
	imminent approach
	of a
	sabertooth by
	gesture  is
	left unclear);
	then when
	they got
	to be
	better predators
	and were
	less concerned
	with unobtrusiveness,
	they were
	able to
	return to
	voice, which
	was now under
	cortical control.
	&quot;The
	dialectic consists
	in {\itshape an
	increase
	in
	the
	level
	of
	complexity
	of
	messages
	}coincident
	with a
	decrease in
	the limbic content
	of messages
	as one
	proceeds through
	calls, through
	gesture, to spoken
	language and
	into written
	language&quot; (emphasis
	added). Steklis and
	Raleigh (1979)
	dismiss the
	gestural phase
	on principles
	of parsimony,
	but maintain
	call-language continuity
	by accepting
	the claim
	by Hockett
	and Ascher
	(1964)
	that progressive
	blending and
	differentiation of
	primate calls
	could have
	mediated the
	transition. <sup>3</sup>
	


	All these
	views share
	the assumption
	that the
	only significant
	difference between call
	systems and
	language lies
	in &quot;an
	increase in the
	level of
	complexity of
	messages.&quot; In
	fact, complexity
	is not
	the issue. A
	given alarm
	call could
	well receive
	the reading,
	&quot;Look
	out, you guys,
	a large
	predator is
	already near
	and rapidly
	approaching, so
	get up
	the nearest  tree
	as quick
	as you
	can,&quot; which
	is surely
	at least as
	complex as
	&quot;the boy
	ran&quot; or
	&quot;John
	kicked Bill.&quot;
	Language depends
	crucially not
	on complexification
	but on
	the power
	to abstract,
	{\itshape as
	units,
	}classes of
	objects, classes
	of actions,
	classes of
	events, and
	classes
	


	Â· of
	yet more
	abstract kinds
	(think, for
	example, for
	a moment
	of all the
	different kinds
	of relationships
	that can
	be conveyed
	by so
	simple a
	predication as
	X {\itshape has
	Y).
	}It is
	these classes, not
	the particular
	objects, actions,
	etc., of
	which they are
	composed, that
	constitute the
	units that language
	must represent;
	but in
	order to
	represent them
	it must first
	abstract them
	from the
	constant sensory
	bombardment to
	which all creatures
	are subject
	(we will
	see how
	in a
	moment). An

	abstracts nothing 
	from  that 
	bombardment,  but
	merely selects
	from it a
	set of
	stimuli (smells,
	colors, physical
	movement, etc.)
	to which
	some kind of
	immediate reaction
	is the
	only appropriate
	response. A
	call and a
	sentence may
	both constitute
	communication, but in
	the ways

	work  they are
	more at odds
	than chalk
	and cheese; 
	for some chalks
	and some
	cheeses at
	least have
	the same
	color and
	texture, whereas language
	and call
	systems do
	not even
	have this
	superficial resemblance.
	


	Hvwever, once we
	are prepared
	to consider
	the possibility
	that language could
	have developed
	in a
	regular evolutionary
	fashion with&shy;
	out having
	sprung from
	some primitive
	repertoire of
	grunts, groans,
	and grimaces, all
	the objections
	to a
	continuity approach
	melt like
	snow in August.
	Once we
	have gotten
	over the
	&quot;communicative&quot;
	hang-up, we can
	see that
	where we
	must look
	for the
	distinctiveness of human
	language is
	not in
	what it
	shares with
	call systems-both
	communicate\-but in
	how it differs
	from call
	systems-language
	communicates con&shy;
	cepts, call
	systems communicate
	stimuli. If
	we don't
	understand con\-ceptualization,
	we don't
	understand language,
	period.
	


	However, if
	we are
	to write
	an evolutionary
	history of
	con\-ceptualization,
	there is
	one more
	ghost to
	be exorcised-the
	ghost of
	Descartes. This
	particular specter
	is still
	haunting the
	behavioral sci&shy;
	ences .
	even though
	the naturalistic
	observations on
	which its
	man\-animal dichotomy
	was based are
	now over
	three hundred
	years out
	of date. If
	you believe,
	as Descartes
	believed, that
	animal behavior
	can be explained
	by principles
	as simple
	as (and
	similar to)
	those hydraulic
	forces which
	activated the &quot;living
	statuary&quot; of
	17th-century French
	gardens, then
	it does not
	seem so
	unreasonable to
	suppose that
	animals are automata
	but that
	we (with
	souls stashed
	in our
	pineal glands)
	are not. In
	light of
	all that
	has been
	learned about
	both the
	structure of the
	nervous system
	and the
	behavior of
	species since
	Descartes' day, it
	is merely
	absurd-possible to
	salvage only
	with the
	logical, if
	counter\-factual,
	strategy of
	the hardcore
	behaviorist who
	would claim
	that animals are
	automata but
	that so
	too are
	we.

	There are
	four possible
	answers to
	the question,
	&quot;Who has
	con\-sciousness,
	volition, etc.?&quot;
	(all the
	so-called &quot;nonphysical&quot;
	attributes summed up
	under the
	illegitimate label
	{\itshape mind
	):
	}animals do,
	but we don't;
	animals don't,
	but we
	do; animals
	don't, and
	we don't
	; animals do,
	and we
	do. In
	all the
	history of
	human folly,
	I know
	of no
	one who has
	seriously asserted
	the first.
	The second
	is Descartes'
	answer. The third
	is the
	hardcore behaviorist's
	answer. The
	fourth, curiously
	enough, has
	seldom been
	made and
	has been
	scorned almost
	as often as it
	has been
	made, although
	in light
	of what
	we know
	now it
	would seem the
	most logical. Since
	it now
	appears that evolution
	has ad\-vanced
	not  by leaps
	and bounds
	but by
	infinitesimal gradations,
	we either have
	to claim
	that with
	respect to
	a particular
	set of
	attributes (volition, consciousness,
	thought, language),
	evolution behaved
	in quite a
	different-and,
	incidentally,  completely
	 mysterious-way 
	from  that
	in which
	it behaved
	with regard
	to all
	other attributes,
	or we
	have to accept
	that at
	least some
	of, or
	some ingredients
	critical to,
	these attributes were
	and presumably
	still are
	shared by
	species other
	than our own.
	I know
	of no
	logical argument against
	the second
	move although the
	emotional arguments
	against it
	seem as
	numerous as
	they are strong.
	Let us
	therefore see
	how conceptualization-
	without which
	language would
	have been
	impossible- could
	have evolved.
	


	Conceptualization is
	intimately linked
	to perception,
	if only
	in the sense
	that if
	there were
	no perception,
	conceptualization could
	not take place.
	But there
	is, I
	think, a
	great deal
	of difference
	between a concept
	and a
	percept, which
	tends to
	be obscured
	by loose
	ways of talking
	and thinking.
	We use
	&quot;concept&quot;
	for any
	kind of
	mental image. In
	fact, there
	are mental
	images of
	percepts and
	of concepts. We
	might say, loosely,
	that I
	have a
	concept of
	the glass
	that is
	presently standing
	on my
	table, meaning,
	I can
	close my
	eyes and
	present myself
	with a mental
	image of
	my glass.
	That is
	a mental
	image of
	a percept,
	i.e., my glass
	as I
	perceived it
	now-empty, but
	for a
	small slice
	of lemon.
	Of course,
	I  could
	imagine it
	completely empty-which
	is a
	percept of
	how it
	was at
	another time;
	or full-which
	 is
	the same.
	However, I
	can also
	have a
	mental image
	of the
	category {\itshape glass,
	}which
	embraces

	my glass
	and all
	other glasses,
	and which
	is not
	a percept,
	but a
	true concept.
	


	In
	some
	species, percept 
	and concept  may 
	not be
	so far
	apart.
	


	Consider the 
	frog.  The 
	frog  can 
	discriminate  &quot;fly&quot;
	 and 
	&quot;not  fly,&quot;
	at least
	as long
	as the
	fly is
	moving. It
	is unlikely
	that a
	frog can
	tell one fly
	from another
	or would
	preserve memory
	images of
	individual flies, even
	if it
	had a
	memory to
	preserve them
	in. In
	a sense,
	percep\-tion and
	conceptualization in
	the frog
	are one.
	Only in
	a sense,
	of course; for
	true conceptualization,
	you  have 
	to have
	volitional con&shy;
	trol of
	concepts, and
	the frog
	is as
	far from
	that as
	from flying.
	But in the
	sense that
	perception in
	the frog
	is generalized,
	it is
	like con&shy;
	ceptualization.
	


	Now, the
	fibers which
	connect a
	frog's retina
	with its
	brain are capable
	of passing
	only about
	four kinds
	of information,
	of which
	only two are
	relevant to
	the perception
	of flies.
	The first
	of these
	two kinds is
	supplied by
	a set
	of neurons
	specialized to
	detect small
	moving objects with
	curving edges;
	the second
	is another
	set specialized
	to detect sharp
	boundaries of
	light and  shade
	(Burton  1970).
	There is then
	a rather
	tenuous and
	metaphorical sense
	in which
	we could
	say that the
	froggy concept
	of &quot;fly&quot;
	IS the
	firing of
	these two
	sets of neurons.
	Of course,
	we are
	several scores of
	millions of
	years away
	from true
	conceptualization; but
	the journey
	has certainly
	begun.
	


	In the
	course of
	those years,
	it might
	have seemed
	that per\-ception and
	conceptualization were
	moving apart,
	as perception
	became not only
	wider in
	range (most
	of the
	environment seems
	quite un&shy;
	differentiated to
	the frog)
	but more
	particularized, with
	so many parameters
	recoverable that
	maybe even
	individuals could
	be recogniz&shy;
	able to
	one sense
	or another,
	or a
	combination of
	several (when
	our dog recognizes
	us, smell
	is presumably
	dominant).<sup>4</sup><sup>
	</sup>And yet
	the basic
	mechanics by
	means of
	which this
	enhanced perception
	 was
	carried out were
	in fact
	no different
	from those
	of the
	frog. There
	might be many
	more sets
	of neurons
	programmed to
	respond to
	many more varied 
	types  of 
	stimuli,  but 
	a percept 
	would  be 
	still  the particular
	


	firing pattern 
	of the
	particular  set
	of neurons
	activated by
	that set
	of
	


	\
	


	stimuli which
	constituted the
	object perceived.
	



	
	



	
	



	
	


	

	
	


	ORIGINS	223
	


	The problem
	of how
	a percept
	becomes a
	memory is
	still far from
	solved. Part
	of the
	problem may
	be that
	most studies.
	of memory have
	really been
	studies of
	learning-that is,
	of forced
	situations in
	which given
	factors caused
	changes of
	behavior. Thus,
	if an
	octopus were trained
	to attack
	horizontal  but 
	not  vertical 
	rectangles,  two
	sets of
	feature detectors,
	each of
	which could
	formerly initiate
	more than one
	program of
	action-advancement,
	withdrawal, 
	indifference\-can
	now only
	initiate one
	each, with
	corresponding changes
	in the neural
	connections involved
	(Bradley and
	Young 1975).
	Unfortunately, such
	findings do
	not seem
	to generalize to
	mammals, where 
	&quot;the search
	for the
	engram&quot; remains
	as fruitless
	as it
	was thirty
	years ago (Lashley
	1950).
	Furthermore, it
	would be
	unreasonable to
	expect them to
	generalize to
	the quite
	qualitatively different
	kinds of
	memory traces which
	concern us
	here. For
	the kinds
	of memory
	traces that modify
	behavior- those 
	traditionally  studied
	 by 
	psychologists-may be
	(although of
	course they
	are not
	necessarily )
	laid down
	in ways quite
	different from
	those of
	memories which
	may only
	modify beha&shy;
	vior in
	the most
	indirect of
	ways, if
	indeed at
	all (e.g.,
	my stored memory
	image of
	my neighbor's
	new car,
	accurate enough
	to enable me
	to distinguish
	it from
	others, but
	unlikely  to
	prompt me
	to steal it,
	polish it,
	avoid it,
	etc., and
	hardly to
	be described
	as having
	been {\itshape learned
	}by me
	except under
	the vaguest
	and most
	vacuous reading
	of {\itshape learning
	).}
	


	Therefore, I
	shall assume
	that long-term
	storage is
	achieved (precisely how
	need not
	concern us)
	by storing
	features of
	images rather than
	images themselves.
	Let us
	assume I
	can reliably
	identify several hundred
	human faces.
	Now, the
	mental representations
	of these faces
	that I
	need for
	matching purposes-I
	can think
	of no
	other way in
	which recognition 
	could be
	carried out-are
	not stored
	separately in
	some analogue
	of a
	box in
	my head,
	not even
	in the
	form of
	macro\-molecules.
	Rather, each
	of the
	horizontal, vertical,
	slanted, curving,
	etc., lines
	that go
	to make
	up faces-as
	well as
	lots of
	other things,
	of course-is
	represented  by 
	a particular 
	set of
	neurons. The
	superset

	composed by
	these sets
	is simply
	an analogue
	of the
	superset of
	feature\-detecting
	neuron sets.
	The data
	recorded by
	the
	straight-vertical-line perceiving
	set of
	neurons (or
	however much
	of them
	are transferable)
	are simply
	transferred to
	the long-term
	storage set
	for straight
	vertical lines, and
	so on.
	The fact
	that a
	particular batch
	of data
	went into
	a particular batch
	of storage
	sets must
	also somehow
	be recorded,
	in terms of
	sensitized synaptic
	pathways  or whatever,
	or l
	could never
	recover Aunt
	Emma's
	face from
	its component
	bits. But
	in some
	such general manner-and
	Iapologize
	to neurologists
	for my
	rather Rube
	Goldberg picture-the
	processes of
	perception, storing,
	coding, and
	accessing must be
	carried out.
	


	It
	follows
	that
	individual
	images
	would
	not
	be
	individually
	stored-members
	of
	the
	same
	class
	of
	images
	would
	not
	necessarily
	be
	stored
	together,
	while
	the
	storage
	of
	unlike
	objects
	might
	be
	strikingly
	similar.
	Let
	us
	consider
	the
	possible
	storage
	of
	the
	percept
	images
	of
	three
	objects,
	any
	one
	of
	which
	would
	have
	to
	be
	separately
	and
	individually
	recoverable:
	{\itshape Aunt
	Emma's
	latest
	hat,
	the
	S
	ugarloaf
	at
	Rio
	de
	]
	aneiro,
	the
	distribution
	curve
	for
	IQ
	in
	an
	average
	population.
	}These
	objects
	belong,
	respectively
	,
	to
	three
	quite
	distinct
	classes;
	the
	class
	of
	hats,
	the
	class
	of
	mountains,
	and
	the
	class
	of
	
	distribution
	curves.
	However,
	in
	their
	general
	shape
	they
	share
	some
	obvious
	simi&shy;
	larities.
	Let
	A
	through
	G
	represent
	sets
	of
	storage
	neurons,
	each
	set
	representing
	storage
	of
	a
	particular
	parameter.
	Then
	{\itshape Aunt
	Emma's
	latest

	ABCDE,

	for

	If
	I

	to

	the power
	of playback-voluntary
	recall of
	images or
	sequences of
	images. At
	the very
	least, involuntary
	playback (another
	name for dreaming)
	does. Reptiles
	don't dreani,
	mammals do.
	Moreover, dream&shy;
	ing (human
	dreaming, for
	sure; mammalian
	dreaming, very
	likely) consists not
	of just
	straight playback
	but of  the
	recombination of
	stored imagery,
	something that
	would be
	difficult or
	impossible if memories
	were individually
	stored. Once
	playback, straight
	or crooked, came
	under cortical
	control, our
	ancestors were
	well on
	their way
	to the world
	map that
	is
	a
	prerequisite for
	language-without
	which there
	is
	hardly
	anything worth
	communicating to
	communicate.
	


	The question
	evolutionists
	will ask
	at this
	point is:
	why ?
	Why should
	mammals develop
	these capacities?
	Prehistory was
	not a
	dress rehearsal
	for {\itshape homo
	sapiens.
	}What
	selective advantage
	did the  species
	gain ?
	Some psychologists
	have  attempted answers
	in
	very vague
	and general terms.
	For instance,
	Harlow (1958),
	discussing the 
	fact  that some
	apes and
	monkeys can
	solve in
	captivity problems
	far more complex
	than they
	would ever
	meet in
	nature, pins
	his faith
	on receptor system
	development, since
	more finely
	calibrated  receptor
	 systems entail
	an increase
	in the
	central nervous
	system:  &quot;As
	long as
	increas\-ingly
	complex receptor
	systems provide
	the organism  with
	 slight survival
	advantages, one
	can be
	assured that
	increasingly complex
	nervous  systems 
	will  develop; 
	and  as
	long  as 
	increasingly  complex
	


	nervous systems
	develop,  the
	organism  will
	be  endowed
	 with  greater
	


	potentialities which
	lead inevitably
	to learning.&quot;
	Similarly, Passingham
	(1979),
	who finds
	it &quot;puzzling&quot;
	that chimpanzees
	should have
	language capacities
	which &quot;do
	not appear
	to be
	used in
	the wild,&quot;
	surmises either that
	&quot;chimpanzees do
	in fact
	use their
	language capacities
	in the
	wild&quot;\-in
	ways which
	two  decades of
	patient and
	trained observation
	have somehow
	still failed
	to reveal!-or
	that &quot;their
	abilities .
	..
	must be general
	ones, allowing
	them to
	do other
	things of
	importance to
	them in the
	wild.&quot;
	


	The vagueness
	and timidity
	of these
	suggestions are,
	I am
	sure, due to
	the Cartesian
	hangover, although
	the class
	&quot;Cartesian
	evolution\-ist'Â·'Â·
	ought  to
	constitute  a
	logical contradiction.

	obvious that
	the power
	to review
	the past
	would provide
	its possessor with
	another power
	of the
	highest value
	in natural
	selection: the
	power to predict.
	Psychics aside,
	prediction is
	based on
	analysis  of 
	past events, and
	becomes of
	greater importance
	as creatures
	evolve and become
	more complex.
	Relatively simple

	keep (literally!)
	one jump ahead
	of their
	prey, not
	only does
	the list
	of conceivable
	contin\-gencies get
	too long
	to program,
	it would
	probably be
	dysfunctional for such
	creatures to
	be programmed
	down to
	the wire,
	so to
	speak. Such programming
	would leave
	them unable
	to respond
	appropriately, to vary
	the moment
	of attack
	in accordance
	with the
	wind, the
	light, the prey's
	motions, and
	countless other
	environmental factors,
	to determine which
	 member 
	of a
	herd  to
	attack, and
	so on.
	The power to
	review past
	sequences of
	events, whether
	at a
	conscious or
	an un&shy;
	conscious level,
	and to
	abstract those
	factors which
	made for
	success or failure
	in particular
	cases, would
	confer a
	massive advantage
	on its possessor-
	or one
	that would  have
	been massive
	had the
	prey not
	de\-veloped along
	similar lines.
	As shown
	in the
	excellent survey
	by Jerison (
	1973),
	brain size
	for both
	prey and
	predator has
	gradually but
	con\-tinuously
	increased throughout
	the mammalian
	era, with
	the predators
	always slightly
	ahead of
	the prey.
	


	We do
	not of
	course know,
	and have
	as yet
	no way
	of determin&shy;
	ing, how
	far down
	the evolutionary
	scale such
	capacities might
	extend. But such
	capacities and
	more might
	have been needed
	to ensure
	the survival of
	the primates,
	creatures who
	were predators
	to some
	species and prey
	to others; and
	it is a
	reasonable assumption
	that {\itshape Dryopithecus,
	}the presumed
	common ancestor
	of ourselves 
	and  the 
	chimpanzees, who lived
	between five
	and fifteen
	million years
	ago, had
	them and probably
	had more.
	


	We have
	so far
	surveyed the
	capacity to
	form and
	store percepts
	


	and  to 
	review  percepts 
	and  sequences 
	of  percepts

	control. But
	we have
	not yet
	considered how
	percepts can
	become concepts. Until
	a percept-
	the image
	of a
	particular entity
	on a
	par\-ticular 
	occasion-can 
	be replaced 
	at will
	by  a
	concept-the image
	of a
	class of
	entities, divorced
	from all
	particular instantiations
	of that class-then
	the power
	to predict
	is  limited. 
	A  creature 
	concerned with
	prediction does
	not want
	to have
	to say,
	&quot;The
	boar I
	wounded three years
	ago did
	such  and
	such, and
	the boar
	I wounded
	a year ago did
	the same,
	but this
	wounded boar
	is a
	different boar
	so I suppose I'll
	just have
	to wait
	and see.&quot;
	It wants
	to be
	able to
	say, &quot;Wounded
	boars do
	such and
	such, so
	I can
	anticipate what
	will happen
	and be ready
	to act 
	appropriately.&quot;  The
	 prediction 
	may  be 
	quite  wrong, of
	course-with
	fatal results.
	But if
	it is
	right just
	that little
	bit more
	often than
	chance, the
	survival chances
	of the
	species are
	perceptibly enhanced.
	


	Indeed, instantaneity
	would have
	rated above
	accuracy. The
	creature that
	could achieve
	60 percent
	accuracy in
	one second
	would surely have
	outlasted the
	creature that
	could achieve
	100
	percent accuracy in
	ten seconds-because
	in those
	ten seconds,
	too many
	of the
	latter would
	have gotten
	themselves killed.
	


	&quot;To 
	generalize  is 
	to  be  an
	idiot&quot; (Blake
	 1808),s
	 but 
	for better or
	worse, the
	road to
	humanity was
	paved with
	generalizations. We
	assume our
	ancestors to
	have been
	primates not
	adapted for
	predation but driven
	by climatic
	change to
	adopt, in
	part, the
	habits of
	preda\-tors-or so
	most anthropologists
	have held
	for a
	good many
	years. Lacking the
	tiger's fang,
	the leopard's
	speed, the
	disciplined pack
	strategies of 
	the  canids, 
	they  had 
	to  compete 
	with  these 
	and  more in
	a dry
	epoch when
	pickings were
	scarce. Under
	such circumstances
	they would
	have selected
	very fast
	and very
	naturally for
	some kind
	of instant
	recognition-and-reaction
	device-one that
	would respond
	not merely to
	the briefest
	of  glimpses of 
	possible  prey 
	or rival
	predator, but to
	the most
	minimal clues
	in the
	environment: movement
	of  a branch  
	at  a 
	particular  altitude,
	 say, 
	coupled  with 
	the  appearance 
	of a patch
	of brown
	slightly different
	in shade
	and texture
	from the fall
	leaves that
	surround it.

	That  modern

	But the
	fact that
	classification
	of the
	genera would
	have been
	selectively advantageous
	for
	our ancestors
	does not
	in and
	of itself make
	such classification
	possible. A
	number of
	preadaptations would
	also have
	had to
	occur, perhaps
	the most
	obvious of
	which is
	cross\-modal
	association-the
	importance of
	which for
	language has
	been stressed
	in a
	number of
	papers by
	Geschwind (1974).
	For the
	concepts of genera
	could not
	have been
	built on
	sight alone;
	each of
	the senses must
	have contributed
	in varying
	degrees. But
	the real
	key  to 
	the crucial
	developments must
	lie in
	the nature
	of the
	recognition device.
	


	Ihave
	said that
	members of
	our species,
	and even
	dogs, if
	their behavior is
	anything to
	go by,
	must be
	able to
	distinguish individuals,
	and there 
	is
	no reason
	 to 
	suppose that 
	our capacity 
	to summon 
	up at will
	the visual
	images of
	individuals necessarily
	indicates any
	very recent evolutionary
	development. I
	suggested also
	that these
	images might be
	stored in
	a fractured manner,
	so
	that  similar sets
	of bits, when
	put together
	in various
	ways, could
	constitute very
	distinct images.
	But why
	in that
	case do
	we not
	project genera
	that would include
	in the
	same category,
	say, {\itshape Aunt
	Emma's
	latest
	hat,
	the
	Sugar&shy;
	loaf
	at
	Rio
	de
	Janeiro,
	}and {\itshape the
	distribution
	curve
	for
	IQ
	in
	an
	average
	population?}
	


	The  utility, 
	or  lack 
	of  it, 
	that  such  a
	category  might
	have is
	


	beside the
	point. If
	we built
	category concepts
	on the
	basis of
	in\-dividual
	percepts, such
	would be
	the kinds
	of categories
	we would most
	likely wind up
	with. One
	of the
	main reasons
	that we
	do not
	is that concepts,
	as distinct
	from percepts, 
	do  not 
	exist  in 
	isolation. We do
	not delimit
	percepts in
	terms of
	percepts. I
	do not
	distinguish Aunt Emma's
	face because
	it is
	bounded on
	one side
	by Aunt
	Mary's face, on
	another by
	Cousin Emily's
	face, and
	so on;
	nor (just
	to show
	that  this 
	fact  has 
	nothing  to 
	do with 
	any heightened 
	perception  of
	


	conspecificsJ
	do  I
	distinguish  my 
	toothbrush  because
	 it
	is bounded
	


	on one  side
	by my
	wife's
	toothbrush, on
	another by
	my son's
	tooth\-brush,
	etc. But
	I do
	distinguish
	deer because
	they are
	bounded  by
	horses on
	one side,
	cattle on
	another side,
	and so
	on; I
	do distinguish
	toothbrushes  in 
	general  because  
	   ey 
	are  bounded 
	by  hairbrushes,
	


	ORIGINS<sub>	</sub><sub>2</sub><sub>31</sub>
	


	

	
	


	nailbrushes, bootbrushes,
	etc. Deer
	stop where
	horses begin.
	Tooth\-brushes
	stop where
	nailbrushes  begin.
	 But 
	Aunt  Emma's 
	face  does not
	stop where
	Cousin Emily's
	begins, my
	toothbrush does
	hot  stop where
	my wife's
	begins. That
	is
	the difference
	between percept
	and concept,  class
	 member 
	and  class. 
	Concepts  are 
	delimited  in 
	terms of one
	another, percepts
	only in
	terms of
	themselves.
	


	Concepts are
	like the
	counties on
	a state
	map, in
	several ways.
	Where one
	stops, another
	starts. Although
	each is
	composed of
	so many acres
	and contains 
	so many 
	individuals, none 
	is merely
	the sum
	of the acres
	that compose
	it or
	the people
	who inhabit
	those acres.
	Each of them
	has its
	place with 
	respect  to
	the others.
	The same
	with con&shy;
	cepts.  Percepts 
	inhabit  concepts,
	,but  concepts 
	are  not 
	the  sum
	of their  percepts.
	 {\itshape Aunt
	
	Emma's

	to the concept
	{\itshape hat
	}and not
	the concept
	{\itshape mountain;
	the
	Sugarloaf,
	}a
	percept, belongs 
	to  the concept 
	{\itshape mountain
	
	}and not
	 the
	concept {\itshape distribution
	curve.
	}It
	is not
	because of
	its
	individual
	characteristics that
	Ido
	not expect 
	to  fmd 
	the  Sugarloaf 
	on Aunt
	Bmma's head
	; it
	is because
	I
	know  that
	the Sugarloaf
	is
	a mountain
	and mountains
	do not
	belong on people's
	heads. When
	Isee
	the Sugarloaf
	for the
	first time,I'do
	not have to
	work out
	from scratch
	all the
	properties it
	has, including
	that of not
	being on
	Aunt Emma's
	head; all
	those properties
	follow auto&shy;
	matically  once 
	I have 
	determined  that 
	it  is a
	mountain. Mountains
	have  their 
	place  on
	the  map, 
	and  so
	do hats;
	and those
	places are
	different.
	


	But how,
	on first
	seeing its
	picture, did
	I recognize
	that it
	was a
	mountain (albeit
	a rather
	small one)
	at a
	distance, rather
	than a
	large if rather
	eccentric hat,
	up dose?
	Not by
	computing its
	peculiar proper&shy;
	ties. If
	I had,
	I could
	have gone
	wrong, because
	in outline
	it is
	less like
	the archetypical
	mountain than
	it is
	like some
	hats. I
	did so
	by putting two
	things together:
	the fact
	that it
	fulfilled at
	least some
	of the qualifications
	 for 
	being  a
	mountain  together
	 with 
	its relations to
	other objects:
	a harbor,
	clouds, a
	cable-car line
	to its
	summit. Of
	course, it
	could still
	have been
	a hat
	in
	a
	Lilliputian model
	city; just as
	the  deer 
	the  hunter  shot
	at could
	have been

	fact was)

	fellow-hunter. The
	fact that
	our maps
	may occasionally
	let us
	down does not
	mean we
	could get
	along without
	them. We
	would be
	no\-where without
	them.
	


	If percepts 
	could be
	filed fractured,
	so to
	speak, concepts
	must
	


	be filed
	as gestalts.
	I do
	not have
	the slightest
	idea how
	this is
	done, nor to
	the best
	of my
	knowledge has
	anyone else,
	although  neurologists will
	quite likely
	find out
	in the
	next century
	or two.
	However, since
	speculation is
	usef ul
	if only
	to provide
	candidates for
	elimination, let
	us speculate.
	Having been
	stored one
	way as
	percepts, in
	a manner based
	on their
	immediate sensory
	images, phenomena
	would be
	copied and stored
	another way
	in accordance
	with their
	observed behavioral
	properties. Did they
	lie still
	or move?
	If they moved,
	did they
	soar, lope, or
	slither? These
	heterogeneous bundles
	of information
	would again, presumably,
	be stored
	in sets
	of neurons 
	synaptically  linked
	with, and
	as specialized
	in function

	If this
	were so,
	it would
	explain why,
	while  percepts may
	be stored in
	literally infinite
	 quantity, 
	the  list 
	of  concepts,
	or  at 
	least the list
	of primitive
	concepts, is
	certainly finite
	and probably 
	quite short (of
	course, an
	infinite number
	of  secondary 
	{\itshape concept
	s-timber
	wolf,
	prairie

	}etc.-can
	be constructed
	by combining

	It would
	also explain
	why the
	human recognition
	device works
	as it
	does. Each
	superset of
	concept-representing
	neurons would include
	representations of
	all features
	of  a
	concept.  If
	indeed the major
	genera constituted
	the first
	concepts (and
	there would
	seem to be
	no likelier
	candidates), this
	would mean
	in effect
	all features
	of a genus-sensory
	, behavioral,
	distributional, whatever.
	Then whenever
	any sufficient

	the perception
	neurons-
	


	that the
	nature  of

	self-evident  and 
	therefore  didn't 
	need  to be

	because philosophers,
	who alone
	could be
	expected to perceive
	the problems
	inherent in
	perceiving anything
	at all,
	have resolutely refused
	to tie
	their ballooning
	speculations down
	to the
	nuts\-and-bolts of
	what we
	already know
	about what
	we have
	in our
	heads and what
	we might
	be expected
	to be
	able to
	do with
	it. So
	the whole area
	slipped between
	the cracks
	of the
	disciplines. But
	that area
	still exists, and
	is crucial
	in the
	explanation of
	human capacities,

	better than
	no map

	all that

	been involved

	suggested an

	observed in the

	(the SNSD).
	We saw that
	both creole
	speakers and

	able to
	distinguish with
	great ease
	between specific and
	nonspecific (generic)
	reference. Now,
	if percepts-images
	of particular
	entities on
	particular occasions,
	therefore specific-and
	concepts-images of
	classes of
	entities, therefore
	nonspecific- are
	stored in
	different places
	and in
	different ways,
	this distinction would
	be built into

	Moreover, a
	name like
	Washoe's {\itshape rock-berry
	}(for Brazil
	nut) is
	a meta\-phor
	at a
	level appropriate
	for barroom
	joking, if
	not poetry
	; it
	shows awareness of
	a superclass
	of which
	both berries
	and nuts
	are members,
	and the
	sharing of
	an abstract
	quality-hardness, not
	normally asso&shy;
	ciated with
	that superclass-by
	nuts and
	a member
	of another,
	non\-vegetable
	superclass. The
	coiner of
	such expressions
	has a
	cognitive map of
	no mean
	quality.
	


	A further
	telling, if
	oblique, bit
	of evidence
	for this
	claim comes
	


	from Gill
	and Rumbaugh
	(1974),
	who report
	that
	it took
	Lana 1,600
	trials to
	learn the
	names for
	{\itshape banana
	}and {\itshape M&amp;M
	,
	}but that
	the next
	five items were
	acquired in
	less than
	five trials
	each-two
	of them
	in two
	only. This
	stunning and
	instantaneous increment
	is inexplicable 
	in terms of
	Lana's having
	&quot;learned how
	to learn&quot;
	in the
	course of
	those 1,600
	trials; learning
	curves just
	don't jump
	like that.
	It is
	much more
	plausible to
	suppose that
	for a
	long time
	Lana simply
	couldn't  figure out what
	her trainers
	were trying
	to do,
	and then  suddenly
	it clicked: &quot;My
	 God, 
	they're 
	feeding  me 
	concept  names-why
	 couldn't  
	they have
	{\itshape told
	}me, the
	dummies?&quot;
	The concepts
	had been 
	there  all 
	the while,
	and only
	the link
	between them
	and these 
	mysterious  new
	things that
	people were
	doing to
	her needed
	to be
	forged.
	


	Finally, Mounin's
	use of
	{\itshape or
	}and {\itshape only
	}is a
	striking example
	of anthropocentric,
	or perhaps
	I should
	say Puritan
	business ethic,
	modes of thinking.
	On the
	one hand,
	you have
	&quot;developing
	for oneself
	the expression of
	one's own
	view
	of the
	world,&quot; an
	activity automatically
	assumed to
	be solemn,
	to be
	heavy, to
	be {\itshape work
	,
	}in fact;
	therefore, on the
	other hand,
	something that
	is {\itshape play
	}couldn't
	possibly be
	&quot;de&shy;
	veloping for oneself
	. .
	. ,&quot;
	etc. Piaget
	(1962) came
	nearer the bone
	when he
	claimed that
	the symbolic
	function
	arises first
	in play,
	and anyone
	who has
	watched a
	young mammal
	exploring the
	environment for the
	first time
	knows that
	&quot;play&quot;
	and &quot;building
	a cognitive
	map&quot; are isomorphic
	activities
	(young lizards
	don't play
	because they
	don't have
	the spare
	brain cells).
	It may
	look like
	&quot;mere
	play&quot; to
	the super&shy;
	cilious
	human observer,
	and  indeed 
	it  is
	play-the  animal 
	wouldn't do
	it if
	it
	weren't
	fun-but
	it is
	also +he
	means by
	which lower
	creatures

	as well
	as human
	children set about
	constructing the
	mental representa&shy;
	tion of
	the world
	which gives
	them varying
	degrees of
	predictability
	


	and thus
	enables them
	to
	control to
	a greater
	extent their
	own chances of
	survival.
	


	Now, if
	chimps can
	have concepts
	and label
	them just
	as we
	have concepts and
	label them,
	and if
	we know
	(or are
	reasonably sure)
	that we have
	a common
	ancestor in
	{\itshape Dryopithecus,
	}then we can
	begin to
	get some kind
	of evolutionary
	perspective on
	the development
	oflinguistic infrastructure.
	When we
	find behavioral
	homologies in
	closely related
	species, we
	can reasonably
	assume that
	these homologies
	represent a common
	inheritance from
	a common
	ancestor (Campbell
	and Hodos 1970;
	Hodos 1976;Dingwall
	1979:Figure 1.4).
	This would
	mean that the
	power to
	conceptualize and
	the potential
	for naming
	go back
	at least as
	far as
	{\itshape Dryopithecus
	}and maybe
	further back
	than that.
	In
	a moment I
	will try
	to answer
	{\itshape the
	}fascinating
	question that
	everyone must want
	to ask
	at this
	point:  &quot;Why
	, if
	language is
	so spectacularly
	


	ap;ie,
	and if
	the basic
	infrastructure has
	been around
	for so
	long, dtdn
	t
	It develop
	millions of
	years sooner?&quot;
	But first,
	there is
	more to be
	said about
	the problems
	of conceptualization
	and naming.
	


	

	
	


	We began
	by tackling
	the infrastructure
	of language
	at just
	that point where
	the gap
	between language
	and the
	external world
	was most easily
	bridged ;
	where the
	classes to
	be named
	were at least
	classes of
	


	discrete Â·entities. Let
	us now
	turn from
	entities to
	their attributes
	and in
	particular to
	color.	'
	


	Color is
	not something
	that really
	exists in
	the
	external universe.
	We have
	all seen
	the landscape

	problems
	for
	language,
	problems
	of
	a
	kind
	
	quite
	
	different
	
	from
	
	those
	
	inherent
	
	in
	the
	naming
	of
	the
	species
	or
	genera.
	Creatures
	
	are
	discrete;
	the
	spec&shy;
	trum
	is
	one
	and
	continuous.
	We
	can
	perceive
	light
	at
	wavelengths
	of
	between
	roughly
	380
	and
	800
	millimicrons,
	and
	we
	can
	perceive
	it
	equally
	well
	at
	any
	wavelength
	within
	
	those
	
	limits.
	It
	is
	true
	that
	we
	can
	say
	of
	some
	colors,
	&quot;that's
	a
	real
	green,&quot;
	or
	&quot;a
	true
	yellow,&quot;
	but
	there
	are
	points
	in
	between
	where
	we
	cannot
	say
	whether
	
	green
	
	or
	yellow
	is
	involved.
	


	If
	Og
	and
	Ug
	had
	sat
	down,
	as
	in
	some
	of
	the
	more
	simplistic
	Flintstone
	scenarios,
	with
	a
	bunch
	of
	
	different-colored
	
	pebbles
	
	to
	help
	them,
	maybe,
	and
	started
	out
	to
	&quot;name
	the
	colors,&quot;
	they
	would
	have
	been
	stymied
	from
	the
	word
	go.
	Even
	more
	sophisticated
	accounts
	which
	would
	still
	assume
	some
	degree
	of
	arbitrariness
	and
	voluntary
	control
	in
	naming
	run
	up
	against
	the
	insuperable
	obstacle
	that
	words
	demand
	concepts,
	and
	concepts
	demand
	boundaries;
	hut
	colors
	have
	no
	boundaries,
	so
	theoretically
	you
	should
	be
	free
	to
	cut
	up
	the
	spec&shy;
	trum
	into
	as
	many
	chunks
	as
	you
	fancy
	and
	draw
	the
	lines
	between
	them
	just
	where
	you
	feel
	like
	drawing
	them.
	In
	fact,
	as
	Berlin
	and
	Kay
	(1969)
	demonstrated
	in
	their
	pioneering
	study,
	nobody
	is
	free
	to
	do
	any
	u
	rh
	thing.
	Basic
	mlor
	terms
	(terms
	neither

	from

	of

	{\itshape 0mn&lt;Je
	,
	}nor
	comoounded,
	e.g..
	{\itshape dark
	qreen,
	yellowish
	brc;wn,
	}etc.-that
	is
	t
	say,
	primitive
	concepts)
	are
	highly
	predictable
	across
	languages,
	and
	the
	semantic
	range
	of
	each
	term
	is
	determined
	by
	the
	number
	of
	terms
	in
	any
	given
	language
	system
	and
	by
	the
	ranges
	of
	pre-existing
	terms
	(if
	this
	sounds
	familiar,
	remember
	it
	was
	exactly
	the
	way
	I
	said
	TMA
	systems
	were
	structured,
	back
	in
	Chapter
	3,
	and
	we
	will
	look
	at
	these,
	too,
	later
	in
	the
	present
	chapter).
	This
	is
	to
	say
	that
	if
	a
	given
	language
	has
	only
	two
	basic
	color
	terms,
	those
	terms
	must
	
	be
	
	&quot;dark&quot;
	
	and
	
	&quot;light&quot;;
	if
	
	it
	
	has
	
	three,
	
	they
	
	can
	be

	&quot;dark,&quot;

	The
	neurological
	
	substrate
	of
	this
	structuring
	of
	color
	has
	been
	explamed
	
	(McDaniel
	
	1974;
	Kay
	
	and
	
	McDaniel
	
	1978)
	
	in

	Jacobs

	Primate
	brains,
	and
	those
	of
	some
	other
	orders,
	have
	various

	the

	fall
	within
	


	those

	The
	far-reaching
	implications
	of
	the
	Berlin
	and
	Kay
	discovery
	have
	yet
	to
	be
	absorbed
	by
	the
	scientific
	community.
	The
	conclusions
	eache
	in
	a
	summary
	by
	Clark
	and
	Clark
	(
	1977:
	527)
	are
	fairly
	typical
	m
	their
	unrevealig,
	indeed
	inaccurate,
	nature:
	&quot;The
	very
	physiology
	of
	the
	human
	visual
	system
	makes
	some
	colors
	more
	salient
	than
	others.

	There
	is
	more
	occasion
	to
	talk
	about
	salient
	colors
	and
	listeners
	assume
	that

	are
	more
	likely
	to
	be
	talking
	about

	confusion
	of
	perception
	with
	lexicalization,
	this
	passage
	makes
	a
	grave
	factual
	error.
	The
	whole
	point
	of
	the
	Berlin
	and
	Kay
	thesis
	is
	that
	color
	terminology
	is
	NOT
	universal.
	If
	the
	
	color
	systems

	the

	it
	that

	starts
	by

	and
	then
	works
	its
	way
	back
	across
	to
	red
	in
	the

	It
	is
	worth
	going
	into
	the
	structuring
	of
	color
	terms
	in
	some
	depth
	here
	as
	'
	believe
	this
	structuring
	is
	paradigmatic
	of
	a
	number
	of
	other
	semantic
	areas,
	some
	of
	them
	much
	more
	important
	than
	that
	of
	color.
	


	First,
	and
	contra
	Clark
	and
	Clark,
	there
	is
	no
	simple
	one-to-one
	relationship
	between
	neurological
	equipment
	and
	semantic
	structure.
	Rather,
	the
	nature
	of
	neurological
	equipment
	enables
	semantic
	struc&shy;
	ture
	to
	be
	divided
	up
	in
	a
	number
	of
	possible
	ways.
	At
	the
	same
	time,
	it
	prohibits
	semantic
	structure
	from
	being
	divided
	in
	an
	infinitely
	greater
	number
	of
	ways,
	any
	of
	which
	might
	seem
	a
	priori
	no
	less
	logical
	or
	possible,
	
	and
	
	imposes
	
	rigid
	
	constraints
	
	on
	the
	
	sequence
	in
	which
	any
	given
	analysis
	of
	the
	semantic
	structure
	can
	be
	rendered
	more
	complex.
	


	Let
	us
	look
	at
	some
	prohibited
	color
	terms.
	No
	language
	has
	the
	term
	{\itshape *reen
	}meaning
	'red
	and/or
	green,
	but
	nothing
	in
	between',
	or
	the
	term
	{\itshape *yellue
	}meaning
	'yellow
	and/or
	blue,
	but
	nothing
	in
	between'.
	There
	would
	seem
	to
	be
	no
	a
	priori
	reason
	for
	the
	absence
	of
	these
	terms,
	for
	it
	is
	easy
	to
	construct
	not
	only
	meanings
	but
	also
	possible
	neuroloical
	substrates
	for
	them.
	Thus,
	{\itshape *reen
	}would
	be
	the
	represen&shy;
	tation
	
	of
	
	activity
	
	in
	the
	
	red-green
	
	receptors
	
	(and
	
	no
	
	others),
	while
	


	{\itshape *yellue
	}would
	be
	the
	 representation
	of
	activity
	in
	the
	blue-yellow
	receptors
	(and
	no
	others).
	However,
	we
	know
	that
	lexicalization
	does
	not
	simply
	represent
	outputs
	of
	particular
	neuronal
	sets,
	for
	two
	reasons.
	First,
	many
	languages
	have
	a
	term
	equivalent
	to
	{\itshape grue
	}'green
	and/or
	blue',
	which
	represents
	partial
	outputs
	of
	two
	opponent
	sets,
	rather
	than
	the
	full
	output
	of
	one
	opponent
	
	set.
	Second,
	the
	factor
	that
	allows
	{\itshape grue
	}to
	exist,
	while
	blocking
	{\itshape *reen,
	}seems
	to
	be
	perceived
	spatial
	contiguity,
	which
	of
	course
	corresponds
	to
	wavelength
	con&quot;
	tiguity.
	Green
	and
	blue
	are
	contiguous
	on
	the
	spectrum;
	red
	and
	green,&lt;
	or
	yellow
	and
	blue,
	are
	not.
	


	ORIGINS<sub>	241</sub>
	


	

	
	


	It
	
	has
	
	often
	
	been
	
	noted
	
	that
	
	spatiotemporal
	
	contiguity
	
	is
	a
	condition
	on
	naming;
	no
	language
	has
	a
	word
	such
	as
	{\itshape *larm
	}meaning
	'leg
	and/or
	arm',
	or
	{\itshape *shee
	}meaning
	
	'shoulder
	and/or
	knee';
	in
	no
	lan&shy;
	guage
	can
	I
	say,
	{\itshape *I
	teach
	on
	mwidays
	}meaning
	'I
	teach
	on
	Mondays,
	Wednesdays,
	and
	Fridays'.
	However,
	a
	further
	look
	at
	color
	terms
	will
	show
	that
	
	spatiotemporal
	contiguity,
	although
	a
	necessary
	condition
	on
	naming,
	
	is
	not
	
	a
	sufficient
	condition.
	If
	it
	were,
	some
	languages
	would
	
	have
	
	a
	word
	
	{\itshape *yeen
	}meaning
	'yellow
	and/or
	green'
	instead
	of
	{\itshape grue.
	}Yellow
	and
	green
	are
	just
	as
	much
	contiguous
	as
	green
	and
	blue.
	Their
	
	conjunction
	would
	mean
	conjoining
	the
	outputs
	of
	two
	oppo&shy;
	nent
	sets,
	but
	the
	same
	is
	true
	of
	green
	and
	blue.
	


	There
	would
	seem
	to
	be
	two
	
	possibilities.
	
	{\itshape Grue
	
	}conjoins
	
	the
	two
	short-wavelength
	outputs
	of
	two
	opponent
	
	sets:
	
	{\itshape *yeen
	}would
	conjoin
	the
	
	long-wavelength
	
	output
	
	of
	
	one
	
	opponent
	
	set
	
	(yellow)
	with
	the
	short-wavelength
	output
	of
	the
	
	other
	
	(green).
	
	Perhaps
	
	one
	kind
	of
	conjunction
	can
	be
	lexicalized
	and
	the
	other
	cannot;
	we
	simply
	do
	not
	know
	enough
	to
	say.
	But
	it
	is
	also
	possible
	 that
	what
	can
	be
	lexicalized
	at
	any
	given
	stage
	
	of
	development
	
	may
	be
	constrained
	by
	the
	order
	in
	which
	lexicalization
	takes
	place.<sup>7</sup>
	


	This
	brings
	us
	inevitably
	to
	the
	
	much
	
	deeper
	
	question:
	
	why
	were
	the
	basic
	color
	terms
	added
	to
	human
	language
	in
	just
	the
	order
	that
	Berlin
	and
	Kay
	showed
	them
	to
	be?
	The
	answer
	may
	lie
	in
	a
	suggestion
	of
	potentially
	immense
	explanatory
	power
	first
	made
	by
	Stephenson
	(1973)
	but
	not,
	to
	the
	hest
	of
	mv
	knowledge,
	s11hfl!'!J11ently

	that
	
	the
	
	Berlin
	
	and
	
	Kay
	
	sequence
	
	of
	dark/light-red-green/
	


	yellow-blue
	may
	reflect
	the
	order
	in
	which
	color
	perception
	became
	established
	phylogenetic
	ally.
	


	The
	argument,
	although
	hard
	to
	support
	from

	representing
	the

	evolutionary
	stages

	all
	be

	nevertheless
	a
	highly
	plausible
	one.
	Stephenson

	would permit
	a much
	sharper and
	finer differentiation
	of the
	environ\-ment ).
	Stephenson argues
	that such
	perception would 
	have begun with
	the longer
	wavelengths.
	


	The transfer
	from the
	phylogeny of
	perception to
	the phylogeny
	


	of language
	would then
	have come
	about in
	the following
	manner. In any
	line of
	development, neurological
	structure is
	always incremental;
	no species
	sloughs off
	its neural
	inheritance in
	the act
	of adding
	new layers;  the 
	new  layers 
	are  simply 
	superimposed  on 
	the  old
	ones.<sup>8</sup><sup>
	</sup>It
	follows
	that older
	layers have
	a longer
	time in
	which to
	establish themselves, to
	multiply numbers
	cells  and cell
	connections. This
	process is
	likely to
	be halted
	or reversed
	only if
	the related
	capacity becomes
	dysfunctional to
	a species-which
	color perception
	is unlikely to
	do unless
	our species
	is forced
	back to
	a nocturnal
	pattern. Thus,
	other things
	being equal,
	the older
	of any
	two capacities
	should be
	the stronger. The
	greater neural
	strength of
	the oldest-the
	light-dark
	distinction-would then
	lead to
	its being first
	lexicalized; the
	neural strength
	of the
	next
	oldest-long-wavelength
	(red) perception-
	would lead
	to its
	being second
	lexicalized ,
	and so
	on.
	


	I shall
	therefore  propose
	 the
	following hypothesis:
	 {\itshape those
	seman&shy;}
	


	{\itshape tic
	distinctions
	whose
	neural
	infrastructure
	
	was
	laid
	down
	first
	in
	the
	course
	of
	
	mammalian
	development
	will
	be
	the
	first
	
	to
	be
	lexicalized
	and
	/or
	grammaticized
	
	in
	the
	course
	of
	human
	language
	development.
	}In
	the
	present
	
	state
	of
	our
	knowledge,
	such
	a
	hypothesis
	can
	have
	only
	a
	
	tentative
	
	status;
	yet
	we
	will
	see,
	when
	we
	consider
	the
	possible
	lution
	
	of
	TMA
	systems,
	that
	it
	can
	still
	have
	
	considerable
	


	power.
	


	After red,
	languages can
	lexicalize either
	yellow (next
	wavelength
	


	down from
	red, also
	the &quot;high&quot;
	member  of
	the next
	color-opponent set) or
	green (the
	&quot;low&quot;
	member of
	the set
	already activated).
	It ma be
	that herein
	lies the
	reason for
	the absence
	of {\itshape *yeen.
	}If one
	or the other
	member of
	{\itshape *yeen
	}must be
	individually lexicalized,
	then a
	large category 
	consisting  of
	just  those 
	members  cannot 
	subsequently  be
	constructed:  lexicalization
	 proceeds 
	unidirectionally  toward
	 an
	eve finer  dissection
	 of
	the  color 
	area, so
	that  while 
	existing categories
	


	ORIGINS	243
	


	

	
	


	may be split,
	they can
	never be
	added to or
	collapsed. But
	again, research into
	the color
	vision capacities
	of more
	species of
	primates may clarify
	the situation
	by demonstrating
	a phylogenetic
	order of
	acquisition for
	the shorter
	wavelengths too.
	


	We should
	also look
	at how
	the meaning
	of individual
	terms is affected
	by  sequential
	development  of
	semantic subsystems
	since there is
	good reason
	here also
	to suppose
	that  similar
	phenomena  will
	be found elsewhere.
	In their
	original (1969)
	treatment, Berlin
	and Kay
	referred to
	&quot;dark&quot; and
	&quot;light&quot; as
	 &quot;black&quot;
	 and 
	&quot;white.&quot;
	Indeed,  &quot;black&quot;
	and &quot;white&quot;
	is what
	these terms
	shrink to
	in an
	eleven-term system
	like that of
	English where
	other terms
	have  spread over
	most of
	the seman\-tic
	ground. Yet it
	should surely
	be obvious
	that as
	lexicalization pro&shy;
	gressively dissects
	semantic areas,
	the meanings
	of the earliest
	lexical items must
	change: &quot;black,&quot;
	which originally
	embraces half
	the spec&shy;
	trum, must 
	gradually reduce
	in scope
	until it
	eventually occupies
	only a narrow
	band of
	it. Similarly,
	&quot;red&quot; in
	a  three-term 
	system  must
	include much-orange,
	maybe the
	darker yellows-which
	 it 
	cannot possibly
	include in
	the eleven-term
	English system,
	which contains
	orange, yellow, 
	and  pink 
	as units. 
	Thus,  the 
	semantic range
	of terms in
	subsystems is
	determined by
	the number
	of terms
	in such
	subsystems and by
	the semantic
	ranges of
	the other
	terms.
	


	Constraints such
	as these
	will loom
	ever larger
	as we
	continue to
	traverse semantic
	space away
	from representations
	of concrete
	entities and toward
	representations of
	ever more
	abstract relationshi
	ps. So
	far. the semantic
	infrastructure we
	have dealt
	with is
	in all
	probability shared by
	{\itshape Homo
	sapiens,
	Pan
	troglodytes,
	}and
	{\itshape Dryopithecus.
	}IÂ·doubt
	whether similar
	sharing extends
	to much
	or even
	any of
	the areas
	we are about
	to enter.
	Indeed, if
	we were
	reconstructing to
	a strict
	chrono\-logical
	timetable, we
	should probably
	drop semantics
	here and
	start talking about
	syntax, since
	from here
	on out,
	syntactic and
	semantic developments
	were almost
	certainly intercalated
	 and their
	interaction served to
	drive language
	up along
	a beneficial
	spiral. However,
	in the interests
	of clarity
	of presentation,
	and to
	counteract  the
	obsession with 
	&quot;communication&quot; 
	that  has 
	so  far 
	vitiated  any 
	understanding

	of how
	language must
	have evolved,
	I shall
	continue to
	deal with semantic
	infrastructure (or
	rather with 
	such small
	patches of
	it as
	there is space
	to deal
	with) in
	order to
	show just
	how much
	conceptual preadaptation  
	was   necessary  
	before   a 
	&quot;communicative  
	system&quot;  as
	


	simple as
	the simplest
	of early
	creoles could
	be made
	to function
	corn- .
	municatively.  Later 
	on, we
	will retrace
	our steps
	to the
	present  point and
	 deal 
	with  the 
	early  development
	  of 
	syntax,  relating 
	the  latter,
	wherever  possible, 
	to concomitant 
	developments  in
	semantics already
	touched on.
	


	

	
	


	The  first 
	of  the 
	semantic  areas
	I shall
	touch  on
	concerns predica&shy;
	tions which 
	may  be 
	felt  to 
	be  central
	in
	any 
	structured  language
	 sys, tern: 
	{\itshape There 
	is
	an
	X
	,
	X
	
	is
	 at
	
	Y,
	Z
	
	has
	}X,
	{\itshape X
	
	is
	Z's.
	
	}I shall
	refer to
	the relationships 
	expressed  by 
	these  predications
	 as
	Existence, Lc&gt;ca.tl&lt;m;&gt;J'
	


	Possession,  and 
	Ownership.  Ishould
	emphasize that
	these labels
	


	chosen only
	for convenience
	of reference
	and are
	not meant
	to nave
	&lt;l!''. any  particular
	 semantic 
	significance: 
	&quot;possession,&quot;
	for  instance, 
	is grossly
	inadequate for
	the semantics
	of {\itshape has,
	}which might
	better, though
	still inadequately,
	be defined
	as &quot;stands
	in
	a close
	and superordinate
	relationship
	to.&quot;
	


	In an
	original and
	insightful study,
	Eve Clark 
	(1970) 
	reviewed the
	ways in
	which these
	four relationships
	are represented
	across a sample
	of  fifty-odd 
	languages.  She
	found  a
	high  degree 
	of similarity in
	the  syntactic 
	structures  involved,
	 but 
	a  good 
	deal  less 
	similarity in
	lexicalization. Some
	languages (indeed,
	 almost 
	half  the 
	sample) used only
	a single
	morpheme to
	lexicalize the
	entire area;
	others used four
	different items,
	i.e., lexicalized
	each of
	the four
	relationships
	differently.  Between
	 these  extremes  there 
	were  several 
	different  pate
	


	terns, with
	two or
	three of
	the relationships
	being jointly
	lexicalized, {\itshape i
	}but seldom
	the same
	two or
	the same
	three from
	one language
	to the next.
	Not surprisingly,
	Clark concluded
	that, in
	this area,
	the lexicon was
	without internal
	structure.
	


	At first
	sight, an
	area such
	as this
	might seem
	to be
	affected by
	


	constraints  far
	different  from 
	those which
	would  affect
	the area
	of ..

	<sup>ORIGINS</sup>	245
	


	

	
	


	body parts
	or even
	the more
	abstract area
	of color
	terms. One
	would not expect
	to fmd,
	for example,
	contiguity constraints
	of the
	type that bar
	items like
	{\itshape *yeen
	}and {\itshape *shee,
	}since the
	relationships we
	are now talking
	about do
	not seem
	to have
	any discernible
	concrete correlatives
	of which
	contiguity or
	noncontiguity could
	reasonably be
	predicated. And yet,
	contiguity constraints
	exist here
	too.

	If the

	4.3.
	Although the
	SNSD divides
	the entire
	semantic area,
	with &quot;zero&quot;
	on one
	side and
	&quot;some
	marker or other&quot;
	on the
	other, the
	presupposed-; nonpresupposed
	distinction {\itshape (presupposed
	}in this
	context refers
	to &quot;information
	presumed shared
	by speaker
	and listener&quot;)
	divides only the
	+specific area.
	Now, there
	is no
	a priori
	reason why
	the latter
	distinction should
	not divide
	the entire
	area; generics
	are +P
	because everyone can
	be assumed
	to know
	class names,
	while &quot;other&quot;
	is -P
	because no
	one can
	be expected
	to know
	which was
	the dog
	that X
	DIDN'T see
	or which
	was or
	were the
	book or
	books that
	Y might
	have bought.
	But, as
	we saw
	with colors,
	semantic infrastructure
	tells you where
	lines MAY,
	but not
	where lines
	MUST, be
	drawn between
	lexicalizable areas
	of meaning.
	


	One feature
	of Figure
	4.3 is
	that there
	is no
	overlapping of
	the territory  of
	different
	lexicalizations; there
	is no
	such thing
	in GC
	as a sentence
	in which
	you could
	change the
	article of
	any NP
	without simultaneously
	changing the
	meaning. This
	generalization does
	not, of course,
	apply to
	English. In
	{\itshape The
	dog
	is
	a
	mammal
	}you may
	change the article
	to anything
	you like
	without materially
	affecting meaning,
	and sentences
	such as
	{\itshape there
	are
	no
	cows
	here
	}and {\itshape there
	isn't a
	cow
	here
	}are synonymous.
	In  fact,
	we  may  compare
	the GC
	situation shown in
	Figure 4.3
	with the
	English situation
	shown in
	Figure 4.4

	to -P
	-S,
	on the
	basis of
	both &quot;indefinite&quot;
	and &quot;other&quot;

	of course,
	once {\itshape a
	}has
	r.eached
	&quot;other &quot;
	it can
	then  spread to
	&quot;generic&quot; on

	of

	nhvious.
	Again,
	two
	semantic
	areas
	are
	jointly
	lexicalized,
	while
	the
	remaining
	two
	are
	separately
	lexicalized.
	Again,
	as
	with
	Figure
	4.3,
	we
	know
	that
	the
	
	pattern
	
	illustrated
	
	is
	
	one
	
	that
	
	is
	followed
	by
	most,
	perhaps
	all,
	creole
	languages,
	and
	one
	that
	cannot
	be
	explained
	by
	appeal
	to
	the
	structures
	of
	the
	languages
	that
	were
	in
	contact
	at
	the
	time
	the
	creoles
	came
	
	into
	
	existence.
	
	If
	
	this
	
	represents
	
	the
	
	primordial
	
	pattern,
	then
	those
	languages
	which
	separately
	lexicalize
	all
	four
	relationships
	would
	have
	reached
	that
	state
	by
	dividing
	and
	separately
	lexicalizing
	the
	tw
	lower
	quadrants,
	while
	those
	that
	jointly
	lexicalize
	three
	or
	even
	four
	quadrants
	would
	have
	reached
	that
	state
	by
	procedures
	similar
	to
	thos
	


	which
	spread
	{\itshape the
	}and
	{\itshape a
	}to
	the
	second
	and
	third
	quadrants,
	respectively,
	but
	without
	at
	any
	stage
	of
	the
	process
	jointly
	lexicalizing
	noncon
	Â·
	tiguous
	
	quadrants.
	


	However,
	it
	
	remains
	
	to
	
	identify
	
	the
	
	semantic
	
	primes
	
	by
	
	virtue
	of
	which
	the
	contiguity
	constraint
	is
	maintained
	in
	the
	domain
	
	of
	Figures
	4.2
	and
	4.5.
	Clearly,
	the
	specificity
	prime,
	dominant
	in
	article
	systems,
	cannot
	be
	involved,
	for
	any
	entity
	must
	be
	marked
	as
	+specific
	before
	it
	can
	have
	existence,
	location,
	possession,
	or
	ownership
	pre&shy;
	dicated
	of
	it.
	However,
	there
	is
	
	evidence
	
	that
	
	presupposedness,
	
	the
	next
	
	prime
	
	down,
	
	so
	
	to
	
	speak,
	
	may
	
	be
	
	crucially
	
	involved.
	
	Entities
	of
	which
	location
	.
	and
	ownership
	can
	be
	predicated
	must
	be
	assumed
	known
	to
	the
	listener:
	compare
	
	{\itshape the
	desk
	
	is
	in
	a
	comer
	}with
	
	{\itshape *a
	desk

	}or
	compare
	{\itshape the
	briefcase
	is
	mine
	}with
	{\itshape *a

	}On
	the

	hand,
	entities
	
	of
	which
	
	existence
	
	and
	
	possession
	can
	be

	must
	
	be
	
	assumed
	
	unknown
	
	to
	
	the

	thus,

	A
	slightly
	different kind
	of contiguity
	constraint has
	recently been claimed
	by Keil
	(1979,
	1981).
	The constraint
	envisaged by
	Keil derives from
	a structure
	which he terms
	a &quot;Predicability
	Tree.&quot;
	A
	predicability  tree
	 defmes 
	the
	range  of
	different  predication
	 types
	


	over various
	semantic classes
	of NP
	(see Figure
	4.7 on
	p. 253).

	furthest extreme,
	predications  such
	as {\itshape X
	 is
	honest
	}and {\itshape X
	is
	sorry
	}can be
	made only
	of the
	class of
	NP that
	is +animate,
	+human.
	


	Keil's predicability
	tree is
	based on
	work by
	Sommers  (1959,
	1963,
	etc.), which
	first pointed
	out  the 
	existence  of
	what  Keil 
	calls &quot;the
	M constraint.&quot;
	The M
	constraint prevents
	any pair
	of predicates (A,
	B) from
	intersecting, i.e.,
	A and
	B &quot;can
	never span
	terms in
	com\-mon and
	also have
	terms that
	just A
	spans and
	terms that
	just B
	spans&quot; (Keil
	1979:16).
	It
	also
	follows from
	this  that 
	no  predicate 
	can  span two
	noncontiguous .
	sets  of terms
	unless it
	also spans
	all intervening
	sets of
	terms.
	


	Experiments  carried 
	out  by 
	Keil  with 
	children  as 
	young  as
	kindergarten  age
	suggest that
	the M
	constraint is
	unlikely to
	be learned by 
	experience.  Even 
	the  youngest 
	children  had 
	somewhat  truncated
	versions  of 
	the  predicability
	 tree,
	and such
	violations of 
	the M 
	con\-straint  as
	were  found 
	tended  to
	support  Keil's
	hypothesis rather 
	than disconfrrm  it.
	 For 
	example,  children
	 who 
	claimed  that 
	dreams were tall 
	(thereby  apparently
	 violating 
	the  hierarchy 
	of  predicability
	)  re\-vealed 
	under  further 
	questioning  that 
	they  believed  
	dreams  to 
	be physical  objects:
	  &quot;They're
	 made 
	out  of 
	rock,&quot;  &quot;They
	just  got 
	grass on  them,''  &quot;They
	 turn
	white  and go
	up in
	the  sky&quot;
	were  among
	their answers (Keil
	1979:110). Thus,
	the violations
	arose through
	assignment of 
	&quot;dreams&quot;
	 to 
	an  inappropriate 
	category,  rather 
	than  a
	violation  of the
	hierarchy  per 
	se. Since
	children's output,
	as we
	have seen,
	is any\-thing
	but  isomorphic 
	with  their 
	input,  it 
	cannot  be 
	claimed that 
	the absence  of 
	M-constraint  violations
	in their 
	speech is
	merely  a
	reflex of a
	similar absence
	in adult
	speech. There
	would appear
	to be
	no way in
	which  they 
	could  negatively 
	defme the 
	scope of
	predications  as
	a result  of 
	inductive  processes;
	 thus,  Keil's
	results  further 
	support  the
	argument  of 
	Fodor  (
	1975), 
	referred  to 
	at  the end
	of Chapter 
	3, that one  could
	 not 
	learn  the 
	extensions of
	the predicates
	of a
	natural lan&shy;
	guage  unless 
	one  already 
	knew  the 
	extensions  of 
	those  predicates.
	


	Although   the 
	M  constraint 
	is  strikingly 
	similar  to 
	the  types
	


	of contiguity 
	constraints  that we
	observed in
	connection
	with  color terms 
	and  the 
	area of
	location,  etc.,
	it relates 
	to  predication 
	(the
	


	\
	


	<sup>ORIGINS</sup>	255
	


	

	
	


	establishment of
	a relationship
	between two
	lexicalizations) rather
	than delimiting the
	scope of
	lexicalization itself.
	 Still,
	since {\itshape have,.
	be,
	}etc.,
	and their
	cross-linguistic equivalents
	are indeed
	predications, it
	may be
	that the
	predicability  hierarchy
	 affects 
	permissible 
	lexicalizations within
	that semantic
	area. We
	noted above
	that existence
	and posses&shy;
	sion could
	be predicated
	of all
	things,  and 
	thus  would 
	include the entire
	tree in
	their  scope;
	location, however,
	 could
	only be
	predicated of classes
	dominated by
	the second node
	down {\itshape (is
	nearby
	Iat
	the
	cor&shy;
	ner},
	}while
	ownership could 
	only be 
	predicated  of 
	classes dominated
	by the
	third node
	down {\itshape (is
	red
	/
	heavy).
	}Joint
	scope  of existence
	and possession
	could  therefore 
	have  favored 
	their  joint 
	lexicalization, while the
	disjoint scopes
	of location
	and ownership
	would have
	favored disjoint
	lexicalization.
	


	In
	the present
	 state
	of our
	knowledge, there
	is no
	principled way
	


	to choose
	between the
	two explanations.
	Those explanations,
	however, have served
	to show
	us other
	ways in
	which semantic
	space is
	struc\-tured, and
	suggest that
	the contiguity-constraint
	 approach
	may yield a
	rich store
	of insights
	into the
	massive conceptual
	infrastructure that
	underlies, and
	that alone
	could make
	possible, the
	simplest &quot;communi&shy;
	cative&quot; uses
	of language.
	


	

	
	


	Before turning
	back to
	survey the
	growth of
	the syntactic
	struc\-tures that
	were based
	upon that 
	infrastructure,  we
	 should 
	look  at one
	last area
	of semantic space
	where contiguity
	constraints arising
	from semantic
	primes, rather
	than from
	the predicability
	hierarchy, appear to
	be operative.
	At the
	same time,
	problems that
	were deferred to
	the present
	chapter when
	we encountered
	them in
	Chapter 2
	(in
	connection with
	creole variability
	in
	the
	treatment of
	iteratives) and
	again in
	Chapter 3
	(in connection
	with variable
	treatment of
	iteratives by children)
	may now
	be dealt
	with.
	


	This area
	can best
	be understood
	if we
	start from
	those problems.
	Readers will
	recall that
	although a majority
	of creoles
	(including Guyanese
	Creole, which
	here as
	elsewhere will
	be taken
	as representa&shy;
	tive)  merge 
	iteratives  with 
	duratives in
	a single
	nonpunctual  category,

	into existence
	prior to
	the emergence of
	language, as
	we shall
	see, but
	were only

	Yet other

	subsequent to
	the initial

	Isuspect
	that such

	they exist,
	will prove
	to be
	minor, and that
	the common
	notion, more often
	implicit  than
	explicit  (if made
	explicit, it
	is hard
	to defend),
	that language
	bootstrapped its
	way upward, creating
	the conceptual
	categories it
	needed as
	it grew,
	pro\-ducing thought
	, consciousness,
	and volition
	as
	mere 
	epiphenomena, is
	simply
	false.
	


	As Itry
	to develop 
	the  scenario 
	of  how 
	a
	language  based
	 on
	the conceptual 
	categories we
	have surveyed
	could have 
	developed, Ishall
	incur a
	heavy debt
	to a
	seminal work
	in glottogenesis,
	Lamen\-della
	(1976).
	This paper 
	represents the
	first
	systematic attempt
	to use the
	development of
	language in
	the child
	as
	a
	possible model
	 for the development
	of language
	in
	the species.
	Lamendella claims
	that &quot;on&shy;
	togeny manifests
	a repetition
	of several
	phylogenetic stages
	in
	the neurofunctional 
	system  that 
	allows  human
	infants to
	learn languages.&quot;


	


	In his
	


	case,
	


	as in
	mine, &quot;it
	strains credulity
	to pretend
	that language


	


	as
	we
	know
	it
	{\itshape suddenly

	show differences

	Thus, at

	the development toward

	logical  foundations  of
	language  would 
	have  been 
	laid  down,
	not in
	a single cataclysmic
	event, but
	in an
	ordered series
	of steps.
	


	This series
	would then
	necessarily repeat
	itself in
	the course
	of child acquisition
	since, as
	Lamendella points
	out, &quot;more
	recently en&shy;
	coded genetic
	information generally
	tends to
	unfold later
	in ontogeny so
	as to
	preserve the
	temporal sequence
	in which
	the new
	components of the
	genetic information
	code were
	laid down.&quot;
	Lamendella is
	careful to show
	that his
	claims do
	not fall
	under the
	two main
	criticisms to
	which early
	recapitulationist
	theories in
	biology were
	subject. First, he
	points out
	that  &quot;embryonic&quot;
	 stages 
	of language 
	may  reproduce not
	the developmental
	stages of
	{\itshape adult
	}language
	but the
	language of
	children at
	corresponding stages.
	At any
	stage, adults
	using general&shy;
	purpose strategies
	might have
	developed language
	beyond the
	range of
	contemporary children,
	although without
	being able
	to transmit
	such developments via
	the genotype.
	Second, he
	is aware
	that embryological
	features do
	not always
	or necessarily
	occur in
	the same
	order as
	their corresponding
	evolutionary features,
	so that
	the developmental
	stages of child
	language do
	not necessarily
	occur in
	the same
	order as
	corre\-sponding
	stages in
	the original
	development of
	language.
	


	With regard
	to this
	latter point
	I think
	that Lamendella
	is top cautious. 
	Recapitulationist  theory
	 in 
	general  biology 
	had  to
	cover a very
	wide range
	of phenomena,
	many of
	which were
	only very
	re\-motely connected.
	Consider any
	pair of
	such phenomena,
	say, dentition
	and
	the
	structure
	of
	the
	foot
	in
	a
	given !':pecies.
	C'leli!rly,	two things
	are not
	wholly unconnected
	since we
	do not
	normally fwd
	herbivores with
	claws or
	carnivores with hooves.
	However, within
	both herbivorous and
	carnivorous species
	there is
	quite a
	wide range
	of tooth and
	foot structures,
	detailed development
	of each
	of which
	must have
	proceeded with
	a good
	deal of
	independence from
	the other.
	It should
	therefore be
	unsurprising that
	on occasion
	the precise
	sequence of
	developments should
	have been
	shuffled somewhat
	between phylogeny
	and ontogeny-that,
	for example,
	in a
	given phylum,
	a certain
	type of tooth
	might have
	developed earlier
	than a
	certain type
	of foot,
	but that, in
	the embryonic
	forms of
	some contemporary
	species, that type

	f
	foot might
	develop earlier
	than that
	type of
	tooth. However,
	when we are
	dealing with
	the development
	of language,
	we are
	dealing with a
	very tight
	subsystem of
	neural structures rather
	than with
	a wide range
	of quite
	dissimilar physical
	features; and
	within such
	a sub\-system,
	a high
	degree of
	mutual interdependence
	might be
	expected to obtain.
	We would
	expect, therefore,
	that reversals
	of phylogenetic
	


	ordering in
	the ontogeny
	oflanguage would
	be quite
	rare, ifindeed
	any . exist
	at all.
	


	Ishall
	not examine
	in detail
	the stages that
	Lamendella proposes,
	which differ
	in some
	respects from
	those to
	be suggested
	here; his
	work was carried
	but from
	a slightly
	different perspective
	and his
	conclusions are worthy
	of study
	in their
	own right.  Ishall
	return  to 
	the last
	of our
	speechless ancestors,
	whose cognitive 
	equipment need not
	have differed in
	any material
	respect from
	that of
	the contemporary
	great apes.
	


	

	
	


	Earlier in
	this chapter
	reference was
	made to
	the question
	why, if there
	was such
	massive preadaptation
	for language,
	it did
	not arise earlier.
	Attempts to
	account for
	this fact
	often take
	the form
	of simply pointing
	to the
	parlous stat
	of hominids
	expelled from
	an arboreal Eden
	and forced
	to compete
	with fitter
	predators; the
	compensatory advantage
	offered by
	language then
	seems self-evident.
	But evolution does
	not behave
	like the
	U.S.
	Cavalry ;
	if it
	did, it
	would surely
	have ridden to
	the 11:t&gt;cue
	
	of	orilla,

	not create
	function unless
	that function
	is already
	within  a species'
	grasp.
	


	This view 
	might  seem 
	to directly 
	contradict  the
	view expressed
	


	earlier that
	intense interspecific
	competition may
	have rapidly
	ex\-panded the
	cognitive capacities
	of our
	species. In
	fact,  there is
	no contradiction.
	Cognitive growth-the
	increase in
	the capacity of
	crea\-tures
	to analyze
	the environment
	and predict
	outcomes-has always
	been the
	major thrust
	of evolution,
	and to
	claim this
	is in
	no sense
	to be guilty
	of teleology,
	since the
	more cognitively
	developed any
	species

	becomes, the
	greater would
	be its
	chances of
	survival. Thus,
	the homi\-nid
	line may
	have been
	capable of
	a relatively
	rapid growth
	of cognitive
	capacity .
	precisely because there
	was already
	a broad
	evolutionary base
	to build
	on. But
	there could
	be no
	basis to
	build on
	with
	regard to
	language, since the
	kind of
	cognitive capacity
	hominids
	were only
	now building-
	the conceptual
	capstone, so
	to
	speak, on
	the vast
	arch of perception
	that had
	been building
	ever since
	the first
	microorganism responded
	to ligh
	t or
	to the
	touch of
	another-was the
	necessary prerequisite
	for the
	most rudimentary
	form of
	language.
	


	Yet the
	question remains. 
	If  apes
	have  adequate 
	prerequisites for at
	least a
	fraction
	of what
	we have
	in the
	way oflanguage,
	then the
	probability is
	that {\itshape Dryopithecus
	}had
	similar prerequisites,
	and that gives
	a period
	of at
	least five
	million years
	in the
	pongid
	line, and
	{\itshape x
	}million years
	in the
	hominid line,
	in which
	the capacity
	for language
	existed, and the
	need for
	language existed,
	but there
	was no
	language.
	


	Here we
	must consider
	the channel
	problem. However 
	refined the conceptual
	schemata, however
	detailed and
	accurate the
	cognitive map that
	a species
	can construct,
	it will
	profit that
	species little
	(except in terms
	of individual
	survival) unless
	there is
	also a
	mode of
	expression. The only
	two modes
	of expression
	that seem
	to have
	even a
	chance of being
	viable for
	primates are
	the vocal
	and the
	manual. Without
	full cortical
	(consequently voluntary)
	control over
	one or
	another of
	these channels, language
	as communication
	would not
	have been
	possible.
	


	However, the
	channel problem
	has quite
	another dimension,
	a dimension
	seldom referred
	to but
	equally critical.
	This dimension
	is, in
	fact, twofold.
	We will
	take the
	second half
	and then
	the fu:st
	half. The second
	half is:
	when A,
	the first
	hominid ever
	to use
	either a
	sound sequence or
	a gesture
	referentially, made
	such sequence
	or gesture
	to B, another
	hominid, how
	did B
	know that
	A was
	communicating referenti&shy;
	ally ,
	and not
	merely coughing,
	clearing his
	throat, scratching
	himself, or brushing
	a fly
	away? The
	first half
	is:
	given the
	same situation,
	how did A,
	totally ah
	ovo, conceive
	the idea
	of represen
	ting some
	object or event
	in the
	environment in
	terms of
	a sound
	sequence or
	gesture-an act
	unprecedented since
	the Big
	Bang?

	of this
	chapter to
	add to
	the already
	overlon&quot; list
	of Plint&shy;
	stone  scenaris,
	one of
	the (possibly
	numerous)  ways
	in which
	language could
	have ansen
	accidentally is
	the following:
	Mrs. Og,
	breast-feeding a lusty 
	one-year-old  with
	 one  hand,
	is trying
	to feed
	herself with  the
	other.  Young 
	Og, 
	ready  for 
	a change 
	of  diet,
	makes  a
	grab  for 
	the meat. Mrs.
	Og
	pushes him
	away. He
	tries harder,
	babbling in
	his frustra&shy;
	tion: {\itshape gaga.
	 }His
	stubbornness amuses
	 Mrs.
	Ug,  sitting
	nearby,  and
	she imitates
	{\itshape gaga
	}and
	maybe makes
	a playful
	grab for
	the meat.
	For a
	while after 
	that,  the 
	favorite joke 
	in  the
	tribe  is to
	creep up
	on somebody, hout
	{\itshape gaga,
	
	}and 
	try  and 
	grab  his  or
	her  meat.
	Perhaps it
	dies out,
	as jokes  do.
	Perhaps  words were
	found and
	lost and
	found again
	a score f
	times
	before they
	took root,
	or perhaps
	the slightly
	older kids
	picked
	


	lt up
	and began 
	to use

	or when

	.or a
	slight variant
	on this:
	Ig, young
	Og's uncle,
	is pretending
	to be a
	tiger, an
	avuncular activity
	still widespread
	today and
	presumably of no 
	very  recent 
	evolutionary  history.
	 Young 
	Og withdraws 
	in  real or

	shouting {\itshape wawa!
	}Uncle

	Many such
	scenarios could be
	elaborated, all
	equally probable
	(or improbable). How
	the Rubicon
	was crossed
	is of
	minor concern;
	what matters is
	how it
	was reached
	and what
	happened after
	it was
	crossed. But origin
	stories like
	these which
	feature Judie
	and jocular
	compo\-nents do
	have some
	advantages. First,
	they do
	not require
	intent on
	anybody's part,
	and since
	they do
	not require
	intent, they 
	do not require
	understanding, at
	least in
	the everyday
	sense  of.
	that  term. Thus,
	t.liey
	neatly avoid
	both halves
	of the
	understanding-intentionality
	problem referred
	to a
	few paragraphs
	earlier. Secondly,
	they are
	based on behaviors-
	imitative and
	joking behaviors-which
	are independently
	attested for
	other members
	of the
	primate family
	and which
	therefore must have
	been common
	to all
	our immediate
	ancestors. Thirdly,
	they provide an
	element which
	may be
	essential in
	the
	acquisition of
	lan\-guage anywhere
	in the
	universe: external
	modeling.
	


	It is
	not, I
	think, accidental
	that chimps
	did not
	acquire language
	until we
	taught them.
	It cannot
	be the
	case that
	they lacked
	the intelli&shy;
	gence to
	invent it,
	since they
	can use
	it creatively
	(within, admittedly,
	quite narrow
	limits) once
	their pump
	has been
	primed, so
	to speak.
	It could be
	that the
	conceptual leap
	is too
	great to
	be made
	in
	a single
	stride by
	any species-that
	some kind
	of external
	model is
	needed, whether
	that model
	is intentional
	(as was
	the case
	with human
	teaching of apes)
	or unintentional
	(by young
	human children,
	as in
	the stories
	above); otherwise,
	the whole
	idea
	of referential
	communication
	would have
	been just
	too radical
	to work
	out (in
	either sense
	of {\itshape work
	out).
	}But if
	this is
	so, there
	is a
	channel block
	for the
	pongid line
	that did not
	exist for
	the hominid
	line.
	


	In other
	primates, vocal
	outputs have
	not come
	under sufficient
	cortical control
	for the
	vocal channel
	to be
	viable for
	linguistic use;
	the great apes
	cannot  suppress
	spontaneous
	vocalizations, have
	very little
	if any
	capacity for
	voluntary vocalization,
	and &quot;show
	little or 
	no ability to
	imitate sounds&quot;
	(Dingwall 1979).
	But if
	hominids could
	have imitated and
	assigned meaning
	to the
	spontaneous vocalizations
	of children, why
	could not
	chimps or
	other primates
	have done
	the same with
	their own
	infants'
	spontaneous,gestures?
	


	ORIGINS<sub>	267</sub>
	


	If we
	replay the
	two scenarios
	given above
	with an
	ape cast,
	the reason will
	become obvious.
	Instead of
	{\itshape gaga
	}for 'meat'
	or more
	prob\-ably
	some more
	general 'food',
	you would
	have had
	some kind
	of grabbing motion.
	Instead of
	{\itshape wawa
	}for 'tiger'
	you would
	have had
	some kind of
	fear behavior.-
	Paradoxically, infant
	gestures could
	not have served
	as proto-words
	{\itshape because
	they
	were
	not
	arbitrary
	enough.
	}For the
	first signs
	to have
	had a
	narrow enough
	range to
	fit individual
	concepts, they must
	have had
	NO RANGE,
	have been
	quite empty,
	communi\-catively
	speaking, so
	that they
	could be
	filled by
	the particular
	refer\-ence of
	the immediate 
	context, hy
	&quot;food&quot;
	or &quot;tiger,&quot;
	as the
	case might be.
	You could
	not use
	a grabbing
	motion as
	a symbol for
	food because there
	were so
	many other
	things you
	might grab
	for. You
	could not
	use a fear
	gesture as
	a symbol
	for  a 
	tiger  because 
	there  were 
	so  many other
	things you
	might be
	afraid of.
	But something
	that had
	no clear meaning
	for the
	parent,  such 
	as a
	child's  pre-speech
	 utterance,
	could be hooked
	to any
	of the
	hominid's preexisting
	concepts precisely
	because it
	lacked any
	such general
	associations.
	


	There would
	be little
	point in
	spending so
	much time
	on the actual
	emergence point
	of language
	if the
	suggestions just
	given were not
	a logical
	outgrowth of
	all that
	we have
	already discussed.
	The major point
	of  this chapter
	has been
	that language
	grew out
	of the cognitive
	system used
	for individual
	orientation, prediction,
	etc., rather
	than out
	of prior
	communicative systems.
	It would
	follow from
	this that the most
	likely means
	of expression,
	when this
	cognitive infra&shy;
	structure finally
	emerged as
	a communicative
	system in
	its own
	right, would have
	been one
	which was
	quite separate
	from, and
	unlikely to be
	confused with,
	the prior
	system. True,
	both hominid
	calls and hominid
	proto-words would
	have been
	in the
	vocal channel,
	but the acoustic 
	ranges of 
	the  modern 
	&quot;call
	system&quot;-shrieks,
	laughter, etc.&shy;
	


	and  those 
	of speech
	sounds do
	not overlap
	and very
	likely have
	never overlapped.
	


	Once the
	Rubicon was
	crossed, progress
	may well
	have been rapid,
	a matter
	of a
	few generations,
	since the
	necessary infrastructure
	for a
	fairly
	rudimentary level
	of language
	would have
	already been

	have progressed

	for
	several millennia
	while awaiting
	the growth of
	the requisite
	neurological
	infrastructure  (whatever
	that might
	


	have been!)
	that would  permit
	them to
	add word
	two to

	falls
	short of
	being wholly
	persuasive. In
	the absence
	of any
	evidence to
	the contrary (but
	bearing in
	mind the
	possibility that
	such evidence
	might appear at
	any time)
	we will
	conclude that
	in the

	able to
	get about

	they   constitute

	for  anything even
	 approaching 
	the  kind 
	of language 
	we have
	today, and

	accept that,

	could  be 
	capable  of

	under no

	give
	
	an  account
	 of
	how  language 
	was  initially 
	acquired, which 
	makes things easier
	 for
	them,  but 
	does not
	do anything
	toward  helping
	us to understand 
	ourselves. What
	apes have,
	what our

	had  to

	You want

	of {\itshape the

	}Since
	in order to
	think this
	all you
	had to
	be able
	to do
	was to
	replay the
	memory of events
	you yourself
	had witnessed,
	I can
	see no
	reason to
	believe that you
	could not
	have thought
	it
	because you
	didn't have
	the words to
	think it
	in. But
	saying it
	is another
	story. Let's
	suppose you
	try. Since you
	have nothing
	approaching embedding,
	there is
	no way
	you can use
	a relative
	clause to
	let the
	others know
	which bear
	you are thinking
	about. Since
	you have
	no articles
	or any
	comparable device,
	there is
	no way
	you can
	let the
	others know
	that y
	ou are
	talking about a
	bear that
	they know
	about too.
	Since you
	have no
	way of
	marking relative time
	by automatic
	tense assignment
	or even
	adverbs, there
	is no way
	you can
	let the
	others know
	that the
	bear you
	want to
	talk about is
	one that
	is not
	here anymore.
	Since you
	have no
	verbs of
	psychological action
	(we'll see
	why in
	a moment),
	there is
	no way you
	can use
	the verb
	form itself to
	inform the
	others that
	you are speaking
	of a
	past time
	{\itshape (remind
	,
	recall,
	remember,
	}etc.).
	You can
	try &quot;Og
	see other
	bear.&quot;
	Everybody panics.
	&quot;Where?
	Bear where?&quot;
	&quot;Bear not here.&quot;
	Some laugh,
	some get
	angry ;
	Og's up
	to his
	practical joking
	again. &quot;Bear

	you try.
	Now even
	the ones
	who are
	laughing are  sneering.
	 &quot;lg!
	lg  dead! 
	Og
	crazy!&quot; If
	 you 
	have  any
	sense, you
	


	shut up,

	will

	of Ug.
	


	

	
	


	It was
	mentioned earlier
	in the
	chapter that
	the power
	to predict
	the course
	of future
	events was
	what gave
	a selective
	advantage to
	those species which
	developed their
	cognitive capacities,
	and that
	this power
	depended crucially
	on the
	power to
	categorize and
	analyze past
	events. Both  powers
	in turn
	depend  upon 
	the quality
	of the
	cognitive map-
	


	'
	


	that could
	advance beyond
	the initial
	plateau of
	the here-and-now
	could potentially
	do
	two things
	which would
	lead to
	an exponential
	increment in
	the survival
	power of
	the species
	possessing it.
	


	First, it
	could code
	the cognitive
	map in
	such a
	way that
	process\-ing time
	would be
	drastically reduced.
	One can
	think nonverbally,
	by processing images,
	or one
	can think
	verbally, using
	lexical items
	instead of images;
	in order
	. to
	utter, or
	comprehend,  or merely
	mentally con&shy;
	struct the
	sentence {\itshape John
	drove
	the
	tan
	Oldsmobile
	from
	Arkansas
	to
	Texas,
	}it is
	not necessary
	to frame
	mental images
	of John,
	or driving,
	or Oldsmobiles,
	or Arkansas,
	or Texas.
	A number
	of psychological
	experi&shy;
	ments (several
	referenced in
	Hamilton [1974]
	) have
	shown that
	where labels for
	objects are
	available, h
	uman subjects
	perform more
	effec\-tively and
	much more
	rapidly; for
	instance, Glucksberg
	and Weisberg
	(1966)
	showed that
	solution times
	for label-aided
	as against
	label-free versions
	of a
	problem differed
	by a
	factor of
	fifteen to
	one. The
	mere fact that
	processing time
	is
	reduced
	automatically makes
	possible many
	analyses that
	could not
	previously have
	been attempted.
	For instance,
	where  previously 
	there  might
	have been 
	only  time 
	to model 
	a single
	


	hypothetical solution
	to a
	practical problem
	(such as
	that of
	dealing with an
	angry cave-bear
	in its
	cave without
	getting killed
	in the
	process), there is
	now time not
	only to
	model several
	hypothetical solutions
	but also
	to compare
	them and
	make a
	choice on
	the basis
	of that
	comparison.
	


	Second, it
	could  make 
	solutions available
	 to
	other members of
	the species.
	Cognitive development
	without the
	power to communi&shy;
	cate the
	results achieved
	by it
	may serve
	the survival
	of the
	individual but cannot
	serve the
	survival of
	the group.
	You could
	remember about the
	bear that
	killed lg,
	but if
	there is
	no way
	in which
	you can
	convey your thinking
	to Ug,
	then the
	odds are
	that although
	you won't
	get killed, Ug
	will, and
	so will
	lots of
	Ug's
	children and
	grandchildren.
	


	True, your
	smart genes
	will multiply, 
	while  their 
	dumb  ones
	won't, but all
	that will
	do is
	bring a
	little bit.nearer
	the time
	when the
	species will 
	break  through
	 the 
	here-and-now  barrier
	 and 
	achieve,  not 
	just

	requirements that

	Y killed

	would then
	call for
	{\itshape X
	keke
	Y,
	}equivalent to
	'X was killed
	{\itshape by
	}Y'.However,
	{\itshape X
	keke
	Y
	}would
	also correspond
	to the structure


	


	must
	


	have  satisfied 
	before  it
	could emancipate
	itself  from the
	here-
	


	NiVNii, in
	which V
	has its
	causative sense
	and Nj
	is
	agentive-yielding


	


	and-now.
	


	First,  the 
	structure  of 
	one-clause  sentences
	 must 
	have  been
	


	stabilized. It
	must have
	been stabilized
	because freely
	variable word&shy;
	order minus
	case-marking devices
	equals growing
	ambiguity as
	two\-and three-clause
	sentences develop.
	In fact,
	word-order cannot 
	have stabilized {\itshape so
	that
	}longer
	sentences should
	be unambiguous;
	there must have
	been some
	motivation  at the
	single-clause level.
	Let us
	consider what such
	motivation might
	have been.
	


	To begin 
	with, we
	need  to
	look at
	something apparently
	quite
	


	unconnected with
	sentence-order- that
	is, word-formation.
	Although there is
	an extensive
	and controversial
	literature on
	the range
	of distinc&shy;
	tive speech
	sounds that
	early species
	(in particular,
	Neanderthal man)
	could have
	produced- see
	Spuhler (1977)
	for references-there
	can be
	little doubt
	that that
	range was
	considerably smaller
	than the
	range of our
	own species.
	Let us
	assume a
	capacity  for
	five consonants 
	and three vowels
	(not much
	less than
	the range
	of modern
	Hawaiian, with
	eight consonants
	and five
	vowels) together
	with CV
	syllable s:ructure;
	this would
	give a
	maximum capacity
	of only
	15 monosyllabic
	words and 225
	disyllabic words.
	Moreover, all
	languages we
	know of
	under\-utilize their
	inventories, leaving
	numernus lexical
	gaps, so  that
	the practically
	attainable total
	would be lower
	still. Factors
	such as
	these would encourage
	use of
	the same
	lexical item
	in causative
	and non&shy;
	causative senses.
	In that
	case, as
	we saw
	in Chapters
	2 and
	3, only
	the frames NuV
	and NiVNu
	(where Nii
	is nonagentive
	and Ni,
	agentive) would
	distinguish causative
	from noncausative
	senses of
	V.
	


	Let  us 
	now  consider 
	a hypothetical 
	word, {\itshape keke,
	}which 
	means
	


	'die' in
	the context
	N {\itshape keke,
	}but
	'kill' in
	rhe context
	N {\itshape keke
	}N. We
	have assumed that
	the first
	word-order in
	early language
	was topic-comment,
	


	'
	


	an  alternative 
	reading,  'X
	killed  Y'. 
	In  theory 
	the  conflict 
	might  be
	


	resolved by
	adopting either
	strict topic-comment
	or strict 
	SVO order, but
	since the
	latter holds
	less chance
	of ambiguity
	than the
	former, and is
	therefore fractionally
	more economical
	in processing
	time, we
	can assume
	either that
	it was
	universally  adopted
	 or
	that  those
	languages that  failed
	 to 
	adopt  it 
	died  without 
	issue. In
	fact ,
	languages that
	did
	


	fail
	to adopt 
	SVO must 
	surely have
	died out
	when the
	strict-order
	


	languages achieved
	embedding and
	complex structure;
	it is
	tempting, although quite
	futile, to
	speculate that
	what caused
	the large
	size
	of the
	Neanclerthal cranium
	was  the 
	apparatus  needed 
	to  process 
	(and store in
	short-term memory
	) multiply-ambiguous
	parsings of
	multiclause sentences in
	which  the
	constituents were
	not systematically
	ordered.
	


	If we
	accept Lamendella's
	hypothesis, there
	is support
	for the foregoing
	picture from
	acquisition
	processes. Bever
	( 1970)
	has demon&shy;
	strated the
	existence of 
	what  he
	terms  &quot;Strategy
	 C&quot;-&quot;Constituents
	are functionally
	related internally
	according to
	semantic constraints&quot;-
	and &quot;Strategy
	D&quot;-&quot;Any
	Noun-Verb-Noun (NVN)
	sequence within
	a potential internal
	unit in
	the surface
	structure corresponds
	to actor&shy;
	action-object.&quot; Experiments
	carried out
	by Bever
	and his
	associates indicate that
	children between
	two and
	three rely
	on Strategy
	C to comprehend
	sentences but
	that a
	little later
	they switch
	to Strategy
	D. This serves
	to explain
	the otherwise
	quite baffling
	fact that
	children's performance
	with regard
	to sentence
	types which
	involve nonagentive
	initial NPs
	(passives, clefts)
	actually deteriorates
	rather than
	improves between three
	and four.
	


	The acquisitional
	sequence Strategy
	C-Strategy D
	would then
	replicate stages
	in the
	early development
	of language.
	Strategy C
	would have had
	to be
	developed in
	order to
	interpret case
	roles in
	the stage

	Strategy
	D
	would

	soon
	as

	stabilized
	and
	became

	of

	relations.
	Note
	that,
	originally,
	adoption
	of

	D
	would
	have
	had
	none
	of
	the
	dysfunctional
	side
	effects
	that
	it
	does
	nowadays
	with
	children
	acquiring
	English
	since,
	
	at
	
	that
	
	time,
	there
	were
	no
	passives
	and
	no
	clefts;
	Strategy
	D
	would
	have
	given
	the
	right
	answer
	every
	time.
	


	We
	 
	can
	 
	assume
	 
	that
	 
	neural
	 
	modifications
	 
	accompanied
	 
	the
	change.
	What
	
	these

	to
	
	be
	
	able
	
	to
	
	accomplish
	
	is
	slightly
	less

	There
	is
	no
	evidence
	that
	
	SVO
	ever
	got
	hardwired
	into
	
	the
	system,
	but
	
	assignment
	
	of
	case
	roles
	must
	
	have
	become
	
	auto&shy;

	and
	underlying

	must

	In
	the

	of
	grammatical
	marking,
	you
	can
	simply
	string
	case

	together
	and

	In

	cases
	it
	may,
	but
	in
	many
	it
	will
	not.
	The
	sentence
	introduced

	for

	would
	come
	out
	as
	{\itshape Ug
	give
	Ig
	meat
	Og,
	}which
	might
	be
	parsed
	as
	'Ug
	gave
	Ig's
	meat
	to

	buf
	could
	also
	be
	parsed
	as
	'Ug
	gave
	lg
	the
	meat
	of
	Og'.
	Note
	that
	parsing
	mistakes
	in
	discourse
	must
	be
	cumulative
	;
	the
	listener
	who
	thought
	lg
	got
	Og's
	meat
	and
	the
	listener
	who
	thought
	Og
	got
	Ig's
	meat
	would
	put
	quite
	different
	con&shy;
	structions
	on
	the
	sentences
	that
	folfowed.
	


	The
	third
	alternative
	would
	be
	to
	preserve
	the
	two-case-roles-per&shy;
	scntence
	restriction
	and
	conjoin
	sentences:
	{\itshape Ig
	have
	meat,
	Ug
	take
	meat,
	Ug
	give
	Og.
	}This
	is
	cumbersome
	but
	unambiguous.
	
	But
	
	note
	
	that
	
	if
	the
	second
	occurrence
	of
	{\itshape Ug
	}is
	omitted,
	you
	get
	{\itshape Ug
	take
	meat
	give
	Og&shy;
	}the
	same
	serial
	structuring
	of
	dative-incorporating
	sentences
	that
	we
	found
	as
	a
	frequent
	feature
	of

	In

	verb
	serialization,
	probably
	arising
	out
	of
	paratactic
	con&shy;
	junction
	plus
	equi-deletion,
	represents
	the
	only
	plausible
	means
	
	by
	which
	early
	language
	could
	have
	broken
	out
	of
	smgle-clause
	structure.
	It
	is
	difficult
	for
	us
	now
	
	to
	
	appreciate
	the
	magnitude
	of
	
	the
	
	advance
	that
	was
	involved.
	The
	single-clause
	apelike
	proto-language
	was,
	as
	we
	have
	said,
	almost
	certainly
	limited
	to
	dealing
	with
	physical

	in
	the

	Sentences

	on sensory
	inputs (or,
	to be
	more precise,
	on things
	that originated
	as sensory inputs
	but that
	have already
	had a
	lot of
	processing done
	to them, along
	lines suggested
	earlier
	in this
	chapter). Still
	more clearly,
	if we
	{\itshape remember,
	}or
	{\itshape believe,
	}or {\itshape think
	,
	}or {\itshape hope,
	}or
	{\itshape expect

	something happened or
	will happen,
	or if
	we {\itshape want
	}or {\itshape hope
	}or
	{\itshape decide
	}to do
	some\-thing, we
	are again
	directly
	representing a
	mental operation
	on the product
	of past
	inputs or
	the projected
	product of
	possible future
	ones, and in
	either case,
	one that
	cannot be
	expressed in
	a single clause.
	The gap between
	monopropositional
	sentences and
	multipropositional
	sentences is  the
	gap between
	talking only
	about observables
	in the external
	world and
	communicating the
	contents of
	one's mind. 
	And the bridging
	of that
	gap must
	have constituted
	the greatest
	single step in
	what anthropologists
	mean by
	the ugly
	terms &quot;hominization&quot;
	or &quot;sapienization&quot;-the
	 process 
	of  becoming 
	the   kind  
	of  species 
	that <b>we</b><b>
	</b><b>now</b><b>
	</b><b>are.</b>
	


	Verb serialization
	helped to
	bridge this
	gap, and
	the way
	in
	which it
	accomplished this
	is worth
	looking at
	a
	little more
	closely. At
	first glance, the
	results of
	verb serialization
	may look
	a little
	like those
	underlying structures
	that were
	once proposed
	by generative
	semanti\-cists in
	which verbs
	were distintegrated
	into what
	were supposedly
	primitive concepts;
	perhaps the
	most widely
	discussed of
	these was
	the
	


	proposed
	derivation
	of
	{\itshape kill
	}from
	{\itshape cause
	to
	become
	not
	alive.
	}Similarly,
	


	if
	one found
	a language
	that expressed
	the
	meaning of
	{\itshape bring
	the
	book
	to
	me
	}as the
	equivalent of
	{\itshape carry
	the
	book
	come
	give
	me,
	}it
	might seem that
	sentences of
	the latter
	type reflected
	the absence
	of a
	means for
	generating derived
	lexical forms.
	Such a
	view might
	lead to
	the conclu&shy;
	sion
	that there
	were two
	types of
	action, a
	type that
	was &quot;semantically
	complex&quot; (capable
	of being
	broken down
	into primes)
	like
	{\itshape kill
	
	}or {\itshape bring,
	}and a
	type that
	was &quot;semantically
	simple&quot; (its
	members being
	themselves primes)
	like {\itshape cause
	}or
	{\itshape carry.}
	


	Such a
	view is,
	Ithink,
	incorrect. There
	is probably
	no action
	verb which
	is either
	intrinsically simple
	or intrinsically
	complex in
	the ways suggested
	above. How
	actions
	came to
	be lexicahzed
	is something
	which, like
	so many
	other things
	of equal
	or greater
	importance, we
	


	'
	


	ORIGINS<sub>	277</sub>
	


	

	
	


	have had
	to skim
	over or
	ignore altogether
	in an
	account as
	compressed as
	this one.
	However, we
	need to 
	note  that 
	verbs  are 
	abstractions from sensory
	input in
	a way
	that nouns
	are not.
	At 
	first glance,
	one might think
	that the
	referent of
	a
	verb like
	{\itshape hit
	}was as
	unambiguously unitary as
	the referent
	of a
	noun like
	{\itshape dog,
	}although
	in fact
	{\itshape John
	hit
	Bill
	}could be
	rendered more 
	accurately  (if 
	more  circumlocutiously
	)  as {\itshape John
	clenched
	fist
	John
	drew-back
	arm
	John
	thrust-forward
	arm
	fist
	met
	Bil[
	}ln
	fact, there
	are perhaps
	no &quot;semantically
	simple&quot; verbs
	that could not
	be
	represented in
	a &quot;semantically
	complex&quot; way,
	and vice versa.
	What determines
	whether a
	particular
	referent action
	is repre&shy;
	sented by
	one verb
	or more than
	one is
	nothing to
	do with
	semantic complexity, but
	has a
	lot to
	do with
	the  number 
	of  case 
	roles  the action
	involves. It
	is
	precisely those
	actions which
	involve a
	number of
	case roles
	that are
	singly lexicalized
	in prepositional
	languages, and
	multiply lexicalized
	in verb-serializing
	languages.
	


	The aid
	supplied
	by verb
	serialization in
	bridging the
	gap between
	monopropositional and
	multipropositional
	sentences had
	nothing  to do
	with semantics.
	Verb serialization
	simply made
	available structures
	more complex
	than had
	existed
	hithertostructures
	that added
	the possibility
	of NVNVN
	to the
	previous NV
	and NVN
	structures.
	


	

	
	


	Now we
	need to
	consider how
	the representation
	of mental
	activities could have
	commenced. We
	have a
	syntactic bridge,
	but we
	also need
	a semantic
	bridge. Ishall
	propose that
	the semantic
	bridge was
	provided by
	two classes
	of verbs:
	verbs of
	reporting and
	verbs of
	perception. Both
	represent actions
	that are
	in some sense
	&quot;more
	phy\-sical&quot; than
	the true psychological
	verbs of
	thinking, hoping,
	remem\-bering, etc.
	Both entail
	dual-propositional
	sentences. Both
	are
	likely to
	be of
	high utility
	in hunting-and-gathering
	communities where
	members frequently
	split up
	in their
	search for
	food and
	need to
	con\-vey to
	the others
	information about
	their degree
	of success
	in that search.
	Ishall
	not attempt
	to determine
	priority as
	between these
	two classes.
	


	Verb-class  membership 
	would  now 
	become  critical 
	in
	parsing.

	The developing
	grammar would
	generate NVNVN
	sequences, but these
	would be 
	ambiguous  between
	 two 
	interpretations,  e.g.,
	NV[NVN] or
	NVN[ (N)VN]
	(where the
	constituent in
	parentheses had
	been equi&shy;
	deleted). However,
	if the
	first V
	was one
	of perception
	or reporting, the
	second N
	would be
	subject of
	the second
	V; if
	the first
	V belonged to
	some other
	class, the
	second N
	would be
	the object
	of the
	frrst V, and
	the sentence
	would be
	parsed as
	a serialization.
	When the
	&quot;true&quot; psychological
	verbs came
	to be
	added, they
	too would
	follow the
	first of these
	patterns.
	


	The development 
	of  reporting 
	verbs would
	have begun
	at the
	


	same time
	as the
	development of
	displacement. If
	I report what
	another person said
	and that
	other person
	is not
	present, then
	obviously the
	saying must
	have occurred
	on a
	previous occasion.
	If I
	tell you
	{\itshape Ug
	say
	honey
	here,
	}it
	requires no
	Socratic intellect
	to figure
	out that
	the honey may
	be here
	now (although
	of course
	it need
	not be)
	but that the
	saying of
	{\itshape honey
	here
	}by Ug
	must have
	occurred at
	a previous
	time (and perhaps
	in another
	place, although
	my capacity
	to translate
	Ug's actual utterance
	of {\itshape honey
	here
	}is
	something else
	that cannot
	simply be assumed).
	However, as
	sentences become
	more complex,
	the need to
	distinguish observation
	from computation,
	earlier from
	later, and general
	from specific
	statements must
	increase. Failure
	to make
	such distinctions,
	preferably in
	some quite
	rigorous and 
	automatic  way,
	leads to
	parsing problems
	which could
	compound even
	more rapidly than
	parsing problems
	arising from
	case assignment.
	Some scaffolding
	is required
	that will
	accurately fix
	the place
	of sentences
	in the
	world of time
	and reality; TMA
	systems supply
	this scaffolding.
	


	Quine (1960:
	170)
	expressed frustration
	 and 
	puzzlement  with
	the fact
	that all
	sentences of
	all
	human languages
	must obligatorily express
	tense, but
	then, from
	Reichenbach on,
	philosophers have
	glaringly failed
	to make
	any kind
	of sense
	out of
	TMA systems.
	Their recipe has
	always been,
	&quot;Take the
	distinctions that
	are said
	by tradi&shy;
	tional grammarians
	to be
	made in
	modern English
	and reduce
	them to some
	kind  of
	a formal
	schema.&quot; Since
	the advantages,
	if any,
	of this
	


	approach  are
	totally opaque
	to me,
	I shall
	discuss it
	no further.

	an evolutionary
	viewpoint, it
	appears plausible
	that the
	only distinc&shy;
	tions the
	first TMA
	system could
	grammaticize must
	have been
	dis\-tinctions which
	were somehow
	already implicit
	in the
	ways in
	which the brain
	processed and
	stored information.
	If certain
	types of
	infor\-mation were
	already stored in
	different places
	or in
	different ways,
	then attaching some
	kind of
	grammatical index
	to the
	products of
	different stores would
	not have
	presented too
	much difficulty.
	On the
	other hand, the
	only possible
	alternative- that
	the species
	invented cate&shy;
	gories for
	which there
	was no
	such preexisting
	infrastructure, and
	then either built
	a redundant
	set of
	infrastructures to
	reprocess it,
	or some\-how
	assigned marking
	with 100
	percent efficiency
	in the
	absence of such
	infrastructure- is
	at best
	an improbable
	one.
	


	People find
	this hard
	to comprehend
	because categories
	such as <b>&quot;past,&quot;</b><b>
	</b><b>&quot;present,&quot;</b><b>
	</b><b>and</b><b>
	</b><b>&quot;future&quot;</b><b>
	</b><b>seem</b><b>

	the so-called

	marks the

	is the
	linchpin of
	Reichenbachian analysis
	is an abstraction
	which can
	never be
	experienced but
	can only
	be inferred by
	beings who
	already have
	produced some
	kind of
	time-marking device.
	People talk
	about &quot;present&quot;
	as if
	it were
	somehow on
	a par with
	&quot;past&quot; and

	the former
	is of

	however probable or
	plausible, are
	artifacts of
	the imagination
	ontologically indistinguishable
	from wants
	and wishes,
	however unlikely
	or even
	counterfactual, while
	the latter,
	although the

	of  the three,
	suffers in

	man. <sup>11</sup><sup>
	</sup>Far
	different is
	the case
	for the
	distinctions to
	be argued
	here.
	


	I shall
	propose that
	if the
	distinctions of
	Â±anterior, Â±irrealis,
	and
	


	Â±nonpunctual are
	the TMA
	distinctions consistently
	made in
	creole languages, and
	if these
	distinctions struggle
	to emerge,
	as they
	seem to, in
	the course
	of natural
	language acquisition,
	then they
	represent the
	primary TMA
	distinctions made
	in the
	earliest human
	language(s), and
	appear in
	all three
	places because
	of their
	naturalness. Since
	the word
	&quot;naturalness&quot;
	has been
	subjected to
	so many
	abuses, I
	had better
	make very plain
	what I
	mean by
	it in
	this context.
	The naturalness
	of a
	disc tinction is
	assumed to
	be an
	all-or-nothing
	characteristic and
	not a matter
	of degree.
	A distinction
	is natural
	just in
	case it
	corresponds to a
	difference in
	the mode
	of perceiving,
	processing, storing,
	or access&shy;
	ing data
	in the
	brain, such
	difference in
	turn
	depending on
	specific features of
	the brain's
	physical structure.
	It is
	assumed that
	only dis&shy;
	tinctions of this
	kind can
	be candidates
	for primary
	grammaticization.
	


	Quite obviously,
	in the
	present state
	of our
	knowledge,  any
	claims about
	brain structure
	can have
	no more
	than hypothetical
	status. This fact
	is no
	excuse for
	imitating the
	ostrich, as
	does Muysken
	when he claims
	(1981a)
	that an
	earlier and
	much sketchier
	account of
	this area<sup>12</sup><sup>
	</sup>&quot;will
	remain arbitrary
	until we
	know a
	lot more
	about the
	functioning of
	the brain.&quot;
	We will
	not know
	a lot
	more about
	the functioning
	of the
	brain until we
	have made
	and compared
	and evalu&shy;
	ated a lot
	more models
	of the
	brain along
	the lines
	of the
	one I
	have tried to
	construct in
	this chapter.
	The idea
	that scientists
	&quot;increase
	knowledge&quot;  simply 
	by  &quot;finding
	out  facts&quot;
	in
	the 
	absence of  any 
	kind of theoretical
	model-building is
	an illusion
	which, remarkably
	enough, flourishes only
	among those
	who themselves
	deal with
	mainly theore&shy;
	tical issues,
	while it
	simply does
	not exist
	among workers
	in the
	physi&quot; cal
	sciences, who
	so mnch
	take for
	granted the
	interaction of
	specula\-tive models
	and empirical
	findings that
	they never
	even see
	the need
	to defend their
	methods. In
	fact, it
	is quite
	conceivable  that 
	we  could track 
	every  dendrite 
	to 
	its synapse
	and still

	the mere

	Muysken was
	right, however,
	in poumng
	out that
	my earlier account
	had failed
	to explain
	the syntactic
	ordering of
	TMA markers, and
	accordingly, the
	present account
	will remedy
	that def!Ciency.
	Let tis
	review
	some relevant
	evidence. We
	know that
	the ordering
	of mark&shy;
	ers in
	creoles is
	always TMA,
	anterior-irrealis-nonpunctual. 
	We know
	


	that in
	VO languages,
	as we
	are assuming
	the primordial
	language(s) to
	have been,
	free verbal
	elements which
	modify the
	meaning of
	the main verb
	usually precede
	the main
	verb. We
	know that
	the commonest
	source for
	TMA markers
	in creoles
	(and in
	other languages)
	is that
	of former full lexical
	verbs. <sup>13</sup><sup>
	</sup>We will
	assume that
	whatever distinctions
	the  original 
	markers  may 
	have  made, 
	the  markers 
	themselves  were
	


	derived from
	full lexical
	verbs. We
	will further
	assume that
	the markers
	


	must have
	been added
	in some
	order, that
	is to
	say, they
	were not ai!ded
	all at
	the same
	time. These
	two assumptions
	seem to
	me to
	be unexceptionable.
	


	Almost as
	unexceptionable is
	the assumption
	that when
	the first marker
	was added
	, it
	became an
	immediate constituent
	of the
	verb, a.rid. hence
	 any 
	markers  added 
	subsequently  would
	have to
	be posi&quot;
	


	J
	ti6ned
	externally to
	the unit
	formed by
	the verb
	and the
	first marker.
	


	&lt;
	Certainly,
	it is
	hard to
	think of
	any motivation
	there could
	have been for
	inserting a
	new marker
	BETWEEN the
	original marker
	and the
	verb. Granted, we
	cannot prove
	that this
	did not
	happen. But
	there are
	ways in'Yhich
	the assumption
	can be
	tested.
	


	Earlier  in 
	this chapter
	it was
	claimed  that
	between  any
	pair of
	


	Â·Â·â¢Â·:it:...â¢Â·â¢disldil&lt;:ti&lt;ms,
	the distinction
	whose neural
	infrastructure had
	been laid
	


	'.fi(\
	dlow'n earliest
	in phylogeny
	would be
	the first
	to be
	realized in
	language.
























	


	282	ROOTS
	OF LANGUAGE
	


	

	
	


	Also, by
	Lamendella's hypothesis,
	the distinction
	first realized
	in language should
	be the
	first  to be
	realized in
	the acquisition
	of lan. guage.
	Thus, in
	principle,  we  have two
	different ways  of
	testing the
	assumption made
	above about
	adding order,
	two ways
	that are
	coin. pletely independent
	of one
	another: if 
	both  yield 
	the  same 
	answer, then  this
	 constitutes  
	mutual   support  
	for  the 
	two  hypotheses,  
	and if the
	answer yielded
	by both
	is the
	answer yielded
	by ou.r
	(indepen\-dently
	motivated) assumption,
	then  further 
	support  is 
	provided  for the
	assumption.
	


	According to
	that assumption,
	the nonpunctual
	marker, being
	always closest
	to the
	verb, represents
	the first
	of the
	three distinctions
	to be
	grammaticized. Therefore,
	punctual-nonpunctual
	should be
	the first of
	the three
	distinctions to
	acquire the
	appropriate neural
	infra\-structure,
	and it should
	also be
	the first
	to be
	acquired by
	children.
	


	In Chapter
	3, we
	surveyed a
	considerable body
	of  evidence which
	suggested that
	whatever children
	might be
	thought to
	be learning (and
	sometimes they
	might be
	thought to
	be  learning
	past-nonpast before other
	distinctions), what
	they really
	learned first
	was punctual&shy;
	nonpunctual. Our
	second criterion 
	is  thus 
	satisfied. With 
	respect  to the
	frrst, let
	us consider
	possible neural
	infrastructures for
	punctual\-nonpunctual.
	One of
	the earliest
	neural structures
	known to us
	is that which 
	underlies  the 
	phenomenon  known 
	as {\itshape habituation.
	
	}In
	{\itshape Aplysia,
	}a sluglike
	marine mollusk
	whose nervous
	system contains
	only a
	hand\-ful of
	ganglia with
	a few
	hundred neurons
	each, the
	sensitive organs
	are extruded from
	a mantled
	cavity and
	consist of
	a gill
	for breathing,
	a siphon for
	eating, and
	a purple
	gland. The
	last two
	serve as
	primitive organs of
	perception. If
	anything touches
	the siphon
	or the
	gland, the gill
	retracts
	into the
	cavity. However,
	if you
	touch either
	gland  or siphon
	at regular,
	brief intervals,
	the withdrawal
	response will
	diminish in both
	speed and
	intensity until
	eventually it
	is extinguished.
	{\itshape Aplysia
	}has done
	its equivalent
	of deciding
	that your
	actions are
	nonthreatening and thus
	it is
	wasteful to
	respond to
	them.
	


	{\itshape Aplysia's
	}actions
	are of
	course entirely
	automatic and
	represent the workings
	of a
	mechanism whih
	has evolved

	them to
	disregard irrelevant
	stimuli and reserve
	their energies
	to react  to
	imminent danger
	or to
	seize feeding
	opportunities. If
	mechanisms such as
	this go
	back as
	far as mollusks,
	they antedate
	by some hundreds
	of millions
	of years
	any mechanisms that
	might underlie
	the other
	two TMA
	distinctions.
	


	Clearly, habituation
	mechanisms have
	grown considerably
	more sophisticated since
	{\itshape Aplysia
	}emerged.
	Each of
	our senses
	has mechanisms
	that filter
	abrupt and
	sudden outside
	stimuli, which
	require immediate
	action on
	our part, from
	ongoing or
	persistently repeated
	stimuli, which do
	not. Driving
	down a
	crowded street,
	we are
	not at
	all perturbed
	by the constant
	movement of
	countless pedestrians,
	but let
	a ball
	bounce off the
	edge of
	the pavement,
	and (hopefully
	) we instantly
	slam on
	the brakes in
	anticipation of
	the child
	that may
	follow it.
	Working alone in
	an empty
	house, we
	pay no
	attention to
	sporadic noises
	in the
	street outside or
	the background
	murmur from
	the freeway
	a block
	or two off; we
	probably do
	not even
	consciously hear
	these things
	if we
	are engrossed in
	what we
	are doing; but
	let the
	slightest sound
	come from the
	rooms around
	us, and
	we stop
	whatever we
	are doing
	and become
	instantly alert. After
	the event
	we may
	tell the
	story as
	if we
	DECIDED to brake
	or DECIDED
	to attend
	to the
	strange sound,
	but these
	are post hoe
	rationalizations of
	our neuronal
	watchdogs' purely
	autono\-mous
	activities. In
	other words,
	the sorting
	of punctual
	from non&shy;
	punctual actions
	is done
	for us
	automatically, and
	it seems
	reasonable to suppose
	(although it
	is still
	far from
	provable) that
	percepts in
	the memory store
	are somehow
	coded with
	reference to
	whether they
	otiginated from
	sets of
	neurons specialized
	for perception
	of punctual events
	or from
	sets specialized
	for nonpunctual

	This capacity

	However, even
	in the
	absence of
	such evidence,
	it
	seems
	likely that anterior
	was the
	last of
	the TMA
	distinctions to
	be added.
	In
	order to
	make the
	distinction, the
	order of
	past events
	has to
	be accessible.
	Perhaps all
	creatures that
	have memories
	have mechanisms,
	as we
	must, by which
	the order
	in which
	memories are
	laid down
	corresponds with
	the order
	in which
	the relevant
	experiences occurred.
	However, recover&shy;
	ability of
	that order
	is another
	matter, for
	any kind
	of recoverability
	entails volitional 
	manipulation of
	the memory
	store, and
	there is
	no reason to
	suppose that
	volitional manipulation
	preceded nonvolitional
	manipulation (i.e.,
	dreaming). Thus,
	the antecedents
	of anterior
	are almost certainly
	more recent
	than the
	antecedents of
	irrealis.
	


	Furthermore, the
	utility of
	anterior as a
	category would
	be unlikely to
	arise until
	discourse had
	become fairly
	complex. Anterior
	marking is primarily
	a device
	which alerts the
	listener to
	backward shifts of
	time in
	a narrative
	or a
	conversation, thus
	enabling him
	to preserve the
	correct sequence
	of reported
	events-a must
	if features
	such as
	causality are
	to be
	extracted from
	it-even
	when the
	reporting diverges
	from that
	sequence. Thus,
	not only
	are the
	mechanisms under&shy;
	lying anterior
	probably more
	recent than
	the mechanisms
	underlying irrealis, but
	the functional
	need for
	anterior is
	almost certainly
	more recent than
	the functional
	need for
	irrealis.
	


	If this
	is the
	case, we
	can claim  that
	according to
	four sets
	of criteria-age of
	infrastructure, age
	of functional
	utility, time
	of child
	acquisitions, and
	sequence within
	Aux-the
	three basic
	TMA distinc&shy;
	tions are
	ranked in
	the order: nonpunctual
	first, irrealis
	second, and
	anterior third.
	<sup>1</sup><sup>4</sup><sup>
	</sup>Note that
	the surface
	order of
	tense-modality-aspect
	which this
	yields is
	not only
	the order
	of creoles
	but also
	what has been
	assumed from
	Chomsky (1957)
	on to
	be the
	underlying order
	for English, and
	perhaps other
	languages too.
	


	Although considerations

	us from survey&shy;
	ing a
	number of
	other features-such
	as the
	development of
	pronouns, pluralization,
	movement rules,
	etc.-which
	 must have
	accompanied or
	closely followed
	the developments
	actually described,
	we have
	carried our account
	of the
	early history
	of language
	to a
	point at
	which, in
	its

	degree of
	complexity, it
	can have
	fallen but
	little  short 
	of  an 
	early creole language. In
	other words,
	we have
	brought language
	close to
	a point at
	which,  for 
	all
	practical 
	purposes,  the
	biological  development
	of  language 
	ceased,  and 
	the  cultural 
	development  of
	language  began. I
	have not
	even attempted
	to provide
	a time
	scale for
	these develop&shy;
	ments, either
	absolute or
	relative; they
	may have
	been spread
	out over two
	or three
	million years
	or they
	may have
	come in
	a series
	of bursts or
	even (though
	this is
	intrinsically less
	likely )
	in a
	single explosion
	of creativity.
	


	Although at
	present we
	can do
	little more
	than guess,
	the sugges&shy;
	tion by
	Hockett (1973)
	that  there  might
	 be
	some connection
	berween the
	emergence of
	fully-developed language
	and the
	sudden and
	ex\-tremely rapid
	series of
	cultural changes
	that were
	initiated some
	ten thousand years
	ago is
	quite an
	appealing one.
	There is
	something inherently
	implausible in
	the idea
	that an
	evolutionary line
	which had existed
	for  countless centuries
	within the
	hunting-and-gathering
	frame\-work in which
	some members
	of our
	species still
	exist should
	suddenly begin to
	grow crops,
	herd animals,
	build permanent
	settlements, con&shy;
	struct complex
	belief systems,
	and evince
	countless other
	behaviors typical of
	our species,
	and highly
	atypical of
	all
	others, merely
	because certain small
	areas had
	exceeded their 
	carrying  capacity
	 (if 
	indeed they had).
	With all
	species, areas
	exceed  their
	carrying capacity
	from time  to 
	time,  and 
	the  result 
	is always 
	the  same-the 
	species moves, if
	there is
	anywhere to
	move to,
	and if
	it is
	not an
	unduly territorial
	species; otherwise,
	individual members
	of the
	species die
	off until
	the balance of
	nature is
	restored. Similar
	experiences must 
	have happened to
	our ancestors
	countless times
	and in
	countless places
	during the
	Pleistocene, with
	its sudden
	and extreme
	changes of
	climate, but
	the responses must
	always have
	been the
	same:  migration 
	or population
	loss.
	


	It seems
	likely  that 
	agriculture  commenced
	 not 
	as a
	reaction to climatic
	change, population
	imbalance, or
	any other
	external cause,
	but rather
	as a
	result of
	vast changes
	in the
	computational and
	com\-municative power
	of the
	species. Dearth

	enced, and
	plans were
	made to
	prevent it.
	The shift
	from taking
	what nature provided,
	an attitude
	characterizing all
	previous species,
	to attempting to
	control nature
	was a
	vast one
	involving the
	power to construct
	an  imaginary 
	future  and 
	then  communicate 
	that  construct to
	others so
	that concerted
	efforts  could be
	made to
	realize it.
	Such attempts could
	hardly have
	been carried
	out without
	the aid
	of a language
	developed at
	least to
	the extent
	that we
	have envisaged
	here; but if
	such a
	language long
	antedated the
	birth of
	agriculture, how
	was it that
	that and
	all the
	other arts
	and sciences
	were not
	born far
	earlier than in
	fact they
	were?
	


	At present,
	no adequate 
	answer can
	be attempted.
	In any
	case, the precise
	dating of
	the events
	detailed in
	this account
	is really
	irrele\-vant. Some
	series of
	events such
	as have
	been described
	must have happened
	at some
	time during 
	the last 
	couple  of
	million  years
	or so for
	our ancestors
	to have
	passed from
	a state
	of no
	language to
	a state in
	which there
	existed languages
	recognizably similar
	to those
	of today. When
	those events
	occurred is
	a matter
	of legitimate
	interest, but
	not one that
	can affect
	either positively
	or negatively
	the validity
	of the foregoing
	account.
	


	No one
	can be
	more acutely
	aware than
	I that
	the account
	given here is
	provisional, 
	hypothetical, and
	can at
	best serve
	as no
	more than a
	rickety bridge
	between our
	present condition
	of almost
	total ignor&shy;
	ance and
	some future
	state in
	which we
	may have
	at least
	a handful
	of relative certainties
	to build
	upon. However,
	the purpose
	of this
	chapter never was
	to write
	a definite
	prehistory and
	early history
	of language, but
	rather to
	show that,
	first, a
	series of
	capacities that
	might be plausibly
	held to
	have been
	latent in
	our last
	speechless ancestors,
	plus some capacities
	that could
	plausibly have
	evolved in
	the course
	of constructing a
	linear vocal
	language, could
	have yielded
	something recognizably
	similar to an 
	early  creole
	language,  and 
	second, that
	on the basis  of
	what we
	at present
	know about
	our own
	species, such
	an outcome-a
	creole-like
	language-would have
	been  intrinsically
	 likelier
	than any
	other kind
	of possible
	language. The
	test of
	such an
	account lies not 
	in whether 
	this  detail
	or  hat
	detail of
	it may
	be proven 
	true

	or false,
	but in
	whether  or
	not  it proves
	possible  to
	build better
	(more plausible, more
	detailed, more
	explanatory )
	models.
	


	If the
	present model
	is in
	essence correct,
	and if
	a creole-like
	language was
	the end
	product of
	a long
	period of
	biological evolution,
	then the
	overall capacity
	to produce
	languages of
	this type
	(itself a
	composite of
	neural capacities
	that preexisted 
	any kind
	of language and
	neural capacities
	that were
	added as
	language evolved)
	<sup>1</sup><sup>5</sup><sup>
	</sup>must at
	that point
	(and for  the
	rest of
	the life
	of the
	species, it
	should go without
	saying) have
	formed a
	part of
	the genetic
	inheritance of
	every individual member
	of the
	species. It
	would then
	unfold, as
	we have claimed,
	as part 
	of the
	normal growth
	development of
	every  child&shy;
	in most
	cases, being
	quickly overlaid
	by the
	local cultural
	language, but in
	a few,
	emerging in
	something not
	too different
	from its
	original form. It
	would merely
	require triggering
	by SOME
	form of
	linguistic activity from
	others-how much,
	and of
	what kind,
	remains one
	of the most
	interesting questions
	we can
	ask about
	language-which
	is why
	wolf children,
	who share
	our biological
	inheritance, cannot
	speak, and why
	the interesting
	experiments of
	Psammetichus, James
	IV, Frederick II,
	and Akbar
	the Great
	all failed.
	


	It is
	not without
	some interest
	that the
	account given
	here resembles, in
	some respects,
	the Biblical
	account of 
	language.  The
	Bible claims
	that language
	is a
	divine gift.
	This account
	can offer
	no objection to
	such a
	belief, assuming
	that God
	has chosen
	to work through
	evolutionary  process;
	 certainly, 
	both  accounts 
	firmly  reject the
	suggestion that
	language was
	in any
	sense a
	conscious or
	deliberate human 
	invention.  The 
	Bible  claims 
	that  our 
	species originally
	 spoke a
	single language.
	This account
	claims the same,
	with a
	slight qualifi&shy;
	cation: the
	issue of
	whether language
	frrst arose
	in one
	group or
	in several independently
	is entirely 
	irrelevant  since,
	 assuming  the 
	latter, all groups
	would have
	had the
	same neurological
	equipment, and
	thus their languages,
	although perhaps
	differing in
	lexical choices
	(as modern creoles
	do,  for 
	that  matter) 
	would  have 
	been  structurally
	 identical or
	almost so.
	The Bible
	claims that
	human language
	diversified coinci&shy;
	dentally  with 
	a  sudden 
	surge  of

	by the
	erection of
	the Tower
	of Babel
	(a tower
	aimed at
	reaching heaven, i.e.,
	usurping powers 
	over  nature 
	which  were
	properly  part of
	the divine
	prerogative). This
	account would
	also claim
	(and I
	will develop the
	claim a
	little further
	in the
	next paragraph)
	that human
	language diversified
	as a
	direct result
	of rapid
	cultural and
	technological diversification,
	aiming, consciously
	or not
	(and in
	our time
	it has become
	a conscious
	goal) at
	&quot;The Conquest
	of Nature:&quot;
	I would 
	be the
	last person
	to adduce
	Scriptural authority
	in support
	of a
	scientific theory, bu!:
	the resemblances
	are intriguing,
	to say
	the least.
	


	

	
	


	The question
	most frequently
	asked about the
	theory presented
	in this
	volume is:
	&quot;If
	our biological
	inheritance provides
	for us
	a ready&shy;
	made language,
	so to
	speak, how
	is it
	that we
	ever abandoned
	that language in
	favor of
	the diverse
	and far
	more complex
	languages of today
	?&quot; The
	answer is
	that, in
	a sense,
	the biological 
	language self&shy;
	destructed. It
	had made
	possible the
	construction of
	cognitive maps
	more detailed
	and complete
	than those
	available to
	any previous
	species, maps
	which enabled
	their users
	to enter
	what was
	in effect
	a wholly new
	cognitive domain,
	a domain,
	in which
	events could
	be predicted and
	forestalled and
	even altered
	rather than
	passively endured
	as all
	previous species
	had endured
	them. It
	had conferred
	on our species
	the power to 
	LIVE  DIFFERENTLY
	-differently 
	from  the past,
	and differently
	from one
	another.
	


	So, differently
	was how
	they lived.
	Previously, as
	in all
	other species, our
	ancestors had
	all lived
	roughly the
	same kind
	of life;
	if they happened
	to live
	near a
	mud flat,
	they would
	include shellfish
	in their diet;
	if they
	didn't, they
	wouldn't; and
	that was
	about the
	extent of the
	difference. Now,
	some went
	on hunting
	and gathering
	and some became
	pastoralists and
	some became
	cultivators and
	some founded
	cities and
	lived by
	farming other
	people. New
	needs arose.
	New cate&shy;
	gories were
	established to
	take care
	of those
	needs. Some groups
	found it convenient
	to code
	verbs in
	such  a
	way  that 
	the evidential 
	status of any
	remark was
	immediately apparent.
	Some groups
	found it
	con\-venient  to
	code nouns
	in such
	a way
	that the
	major semantic
	classes
	


	'
	


	<sup>ORIGINS</sup>	291
	


	

	
	


	to which
	they belonged
	were immediately
	apparent. These
	new cate&shy;
	gories were
	superimposed  on 
	the old
	ones, but
	a language
	is a
	system or it
	is nothing,
	so that
	this superimposition
	shifted and
	distorted the
	older, more
	&quot;natural&quot;
	categories and
	in some
	cases, perhaps, 
	overlaid them completely.
	This, too,
	was natural,
	in its
	way. No
	biological language could
	have been
	designed to
	su'it the
	needs of
	all humans under
	all the
	different circumstances
	in which
	humans could 
	live; indeed, if
	any such
	language could
	have been
	designed, it would
	either have been
	itself subject
	to change
	(since cultural
	evolution is
	not  a closed
	process) or
	if not
	so subject
	would have been
	positively dys&shy;
	functional, since
	it could
	not have
	adapted to
	our changing
	needs and
	priorities. Thus,
	one hundred
	centuries of
	cultural change
	and develop&shy;
	ment have
	produced the
	world of
	diverse, yet
	underlyingly similar,
	languages which
	we know
	today.
	


	

	
	


	But not
	only cultural
	factors served
	to change
	the bioprogram
	language. Factors
	concerned with
	language processing
	are also
	opera\-tive. I
	will illustrate
	just  two
	different types
	of such
	factors here.
	


	The first
	involves relative
	clauses. As
	we saw
	in Chapter
	1,
	HCE has no
	surface marker
	of relativization,
	even where
	English obligatorily
	requires one,
	provided that
	there is
	a head
	noun. If
	there is
	not a
	head noun, then
	an English
	relative pronoun
	is supplied.
	Thus, we
	get headed
	relatives like
	{\itshape da
	gai
	gon
	lei
	da
	vainil
	fo
	mi
	bin
	kwot
	mi
	prais
	}'The
	guy WHO was
	going to
	lay the
	vinyl for
	me had
	quoted me
	a price',
	with no marking,
	but headless
	relatives like
	{\itshape hu
	go
	daun
	frs
	iz
	luza
	}'(THE ONE)
	who goes
	down first  is
	the loser',
	with an
	English relative
	pro\-noun. 
	Obviously,  the 
	difficulty  of  
	incorporating   English
	  relatives per
	se cannot be
	what is
	responsible for
	sentences of
	the first 
	type. Rather, the
	cause must
	be, first,
	that all
	HCE sentences
	require  some kind
	of overt subject 
	(except  imperatives,  of
	course), and,
	second, that as
	we hypothesized
	in earlier
	chapters, HCE
	lacks-&quot;used to
	lack&quot; might
	be  more 
	accurate-a rule 
	that  would
	rewrite  NP as
	N S,
	but  possesses
	a rule
	that would
	rewrite NP
	simply as
	S, thus
	yielding the
	structure NP(NP V
	X] VP
	for both
	the above
	sentences.

	LANGUAGE
	


	However, as
	was shown
	in Bever
	and Langendoen
	(1971),
	zero relative pronouns in
	sentences where
	the head
	noun is
	subject of
	the relative clause
	can cause
	serious ambiguities
	in
	a minority
	of sentences.
	Practically all
	creoles now
	have some
	kind of
	relative marking,
	pre\-sumably as
	a consequence
	of such
	processing problems.
	Thus, change away
	from the
	bioprogram  pattern
	can set
	in very
	quickly  even whee
	it  is
	not  triggered 
	by  language 
	contact, if
	the  functional 
	pressure  ls
	


	sufficient.
	


	The second
	factor involves
	word order.
	It has
	been claimed
	here that the
	original language
	order was  SVO
	with  serialization
	but  that this 
	order  was 
	not  necessarily 
	hard-wired.  This 
	directly  contradicts
	a claim
	by Giv6n 
	(1979:Chapter
	7)  that  the 
	original  language
	 order
	was SOV.
	Giv6n's evidence
	is that
	a majority
	of the
	world's
	language families
	are either
	synchronically SOV
	or reconstruct
	back to 
	SOV, while change
	in the
	reverse direction
	is rare.
	But in
	fact, serial
	SVO often forms
	an intermediate
	stage between
	SVO and
	SOV in
	Austro\-nesian
	languages which
	are changing
	under the
	influence of
	Papuan languages
	(Bradshaw 1979).
	In our
	original language,
	a similar
	change could  have
	 come 
	about  in
	 the 
	following  manner:
	 first, 
	there  occur
	a number of
	NVNVN sequences
	in which
	the final
	N is
	realized as
	a pronoun; second,
	object  pronouns 
	become  diticized;
	third,  the 
	first &quot;. is
	reanalyzed as
	a preposition.
	In this
	way, a
	structure that
	was .or&shy;
	ginally analyzed
	as
	Subject-Verb-Object-Verb-Object
	changes unt
	il it
	can  be  
	reanalyzed  
	as 
	Subject-Preposition-Oblique 
	Case-Verb- SXV,
	in fact.
	This is
	then interpreted
	as the 
	canonical  order,
	and any
	foll\-NP objects
	left behind
	the verb
	are moved
	in front
	of it
	in order
	to remove what
	now appears
	to be
	an anomaly.
	It is,
	of course,
	not necessarily  implied
	 that
	all early
	languages followed
	 this
	course; but if
	a number
	of them
	did, then
	the data
	which Giv6n
	took as
	proof of original
	SOV
	could easily
	be accounted
	for.
	


	

	
	


	There is
	not space
	here to
	discuss in
	detail how
	the bioprogram
	theory would
	affect the
	theory of
	linguistic change.
	It shuld
	?e apparent
	that an
	entire volume
	could easily
	be written
	on this
	topic.

	<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-right: 0.1in; text-indent: -0.01in; line-height: 105%">	The study	of linguistic	change has	been effectively	paralyzed for	many decades by	the empirically	groundless belief	that all	the	world's current	languages are	at	a	similar level	of	development.	Even the
	study of
	Greenbergian universals
	led only
	to suggestions
	of a
	kind of
	ceaseless seesawing
	between OV
	and VO
	orders. Iwould
	predict that,
	tight or
	wrong, the
	present theory
	would at
	least give
	something tangible
	for
	diachronic linguistics
	to chew
	on.
	<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-right: 0.09in; text-indent: 0.41in; margin-top: 0in; line-height: 110%">	However, it	should at	least be	pointed  out 	that  the 	present theory does	not claim	a steady	progression away	from the	biopro\-grarnmed	base. Quite	apart from	the drastic	recyclings which	pidginiza\-tion	precipitates, there	are likely
	to be
	partial reemergences
	of bio&shy;
	program features
	in a number
	of linguistic
	situations, prominent
	among these
	being, first,
	the constant
	surfacing of
	so-called &quot;subscandard&quot;
	varieties in
	classes where
	prescriptive monitoring
	is  minimal, 
	and second, contacts
	between  typologically
	 different 
	languages  (such 
	as the
	Austronesian-Papuan clash
	mentioned above)
	which set in
	motion extreme change
	processes in
	one party 
	or  the 
	other. Thus, 
	despite  a very
	rightly skeptical
	survey by
	Polome (1980)
	which concludes
	that creolization
	may hardly
	ever or
	never have
	been responsible
	for histo&shy;
	rical changes,
	. there
	may still
	be some
	truth  in 
	the  persistent  claims
	that Germanic,
	or Egyptian,
	or Old
	Japanese may
	owe some
	of their features
	to &quot;creolization.&quot;
	In fact,
	Polome would
	still be
	correct in
	claiming that
	true creolization
	had not
	taken place;
	the creole-like
	features would
	be derived
	from the
	same bioprogram
	that is
	responsible for
	creoles and
	for many
	acquisitional features,
	but  surfacing 
	under rather different
	and somewhat
	less radical
	circumstances than
	those which give
	rise to
	creoles.
	


	We have
	now completed
	our survey
	of creoles,
	acquisition, and
	origins, showing
	the wide
	range of
	similarities that
	unite the
	first two and
	that could
	derive in
	both cases
	from the
	reenactment of
	the third. In
	the fifth
	and final
	chapter I
	shall briefly
	summarize the
	theory which
	these findings
	support, and
	place it
	in the
	context of
	existing linguistic
	theories, and
	I shall

	at a
	few of
	the more

	CONCLUSIONS
	



	
	



	
	



	
	



	
	


	

	
	


	The
	foregoing
	chapters
	have
	surveyed
	the
	three
	major
	areas
	of
	language
	development:
	 
	development
	
	in
	
	the
	
	individual,
	
	developn:ent
	 
	of
	
	new
	languages,
	
	and
	
	original
	
	development
	
	of
	
	language.
	
	Parsimony
	
	alo1
	e
	would
	suggest
	that
	these
	developmental
	processes
	might
	have
	much
	m
	common
	with
	one
	another,
	and
	the
	common
	pattern
	
	that
	emerges
	has
	an
	independent
	
	support
	
	that
	no
	other
	linguistic
	
	theory
	
	that
	
	I
	know
	of
	could
	claim:
	it
	is
	in
	accord
	with
	all
	we
	have

	in
	the

	determine
	
	the
	
	hehavior
	
	of
	animate
	creatures.
	During
	the
	sixties
	and
	seventies,
	we
	heard
	a
	good
	deal
	about
	something
	
	called
	
	&quot;psychological
	
	reality,&quot;
	although
	
	what
	
	it
	
	was
	
	was
	never
	well
	defined;
	I
	would
	suggest
	that
	whatever
	the
	fate
	of
	the
	theory
	argued
	here,
	any
	future
	linguistic
	theory
	will
	have
	to
	be
	able
	to
	claim
	


	&quot;biological
	reality&quot;
	if
	it
	is
	to
	be
	taken
	seriously.	â¢
	The
	theory
	
	argued
	
	here
	has
	claimed
	
	that
	many
	
	of
	the
	prerequ1-
	


	sites
	for
	human
	language
	were
	laid
	down
	in
	the
	course
	of
	mammalian
	evolution,
	and
	that
	the
	most
	critical
	of
	those
	prerequisites-
	for
	even
	things
	like
	vocal

	were
	necessary,
	but
	in
	no

	-perhaps
	{\itshape Homo
	erectus,
	}perhaps
	some
	other
	species-to
	lexicalize
	concepts
	and
	construct
	a
	primitive
	form
	of
	language
	probably
	not
	too
	dissimilar
	to
	that
	achievable,
	under
	training,
	by
	modern
	apes.
	Language
	even
	at
	so
	primitive
	a
	level
	conferred
	a
	sharp,
	selective
	advantage
	to
	its
	users.
	Over
	a
	long
	period,
	language
	developed
	biologically
	in
	the
	follow&shy;
	ing
	manner.
	In
	any
	group
	of
	any
	species,
	there
	is
	a
	certain
	amount
	of
	random
	variation
	which
	allows
	for
	variation
	in
	individual
	skill.
	Those
	individuals
	who
	had
	higher
	skills
	in
	the
	manipulation
	of
	language
	had
	those
	skills
	as
	a
	direct
	result
	of
	the
	fact
	that
	such
	random
	variation
	had
	produced,
	in
	their
	brains,
	mechanisms
	better
	adapted
	for
	converting
	preexisting
	mental
	representations
	into
	linguistic
	fonn
	by
	lexicalizing
	and
	grammaticizing
	the
	categories
	into
	which
	those
	representations
	were
	already
	sorted
	by
	neurological
	processes.
	Since
	language-skilled
	individuals
	possessed
	a
	higher
	potential
	for
	survival,
	they
	would
	pro&shy;
	duce
	more
	offspring
	than
	other
	
	individuals,
	
	and
	
	the
	
	capacities
	that
	had
	arisen
	in
	them
	by
	random
	variation
	would
	he
	preserved
	and
	trans&shy;
	mitted
	intact
	to
	their
	descendants.
	


	Note
	
	that
	there
	is
	nothing
	particularly
	
	novel
	about
	all
	of
	this;
	most
	
	people
	
	nowadays
	
	would
	
	agree
	without
	
	any
	hesitation
	that
	the
	giraffe's
	neck,
	the
	hummingbird'
	s
	bill,
	and
	all
	other
	adaptive
	develop&shy;
	ments
	 ON 
	A
	PHYSICAL
	
	LEVEL
	
	have
	originated
	
	in
	precisely
	
	this
	manner.
	It
	is
	merely
	the
	superstitious
	persistence
	of
	Cartesian
	dualism
	that
	makes
	people
	reluctant
	to
	admit
	that
	since
	mental
	characteristics
	just
	
	as
	
	firm
	
	a
	
	physical
	
	foundation
	
	in
	 neurological 
	structures,
	


	the
	same
	processes
	of
	biological
	evolution
	must
	apply
	to
	them
	also.
	


	If
	language
	arose
	in
	the
	way
	I
	have
	indicated,
	then
	what
	was
	passed
	on
	from
	generation
	to
	generation
	was
	not
	some
	vague,
	abstract
	&quot;general
	learning
	capacity,&quot;
	or
	even
	some
	highly-specified

	learning capacity.&quot;
	Biological evolution
	does not
	trade in
	nebulous concepts like
	these ;
	it hands
	out concrete
	features, concrete
	capacities for specific
	operations. What
	was passed
	on was
	precisely the
	capacity to produce
	a particular,
	highly-specified
	language, given
	only some (perhaps
	quite minimal)
	triggering in
	the form
	of communal
	language use. This
	capacity had
	attained the
	level of
	contemporary creoles
	when the computational
	power it
	bestowed on
	its owners
	triggered the
	cultural explosion of
	the last
	ten millennia;<sup>2</sup><sup>
	</sup>and since
	cultural evolu&shy;
	tion works
	far faster
	than biological
	evolution, and
	since it
	operates at
	a far more
	abstract level,
	the effects
	of cultural
	evolution on
	language could not
	be transferred
	to the
	gene pool.
	Therefore, biological
	lan\-guage remained
	right where
	it was,
	while cultural
	language rode
	off in all
	directions. However,
	it was
	always there,
	under the
	surface, waiting
	to emerge
	whenever cultural
	language  hit 
	a bad 
	patch,  so
	to speak
	; and the
	worst patch
	that cultural
	language ever
	hit was
	the unprece&shy;
	dented, culture-shattering
	act of
	the European
	colonialists who
	set up the
	slave trade.
	But it
	is true
	that out
	of evil,
	good may
	come, and
	if they had
	not done
	this, we
	might never
	have  found 
	the  one  crucial
	clue to
	the history
	of our
	species.
	


	However, even
	without such 
	setbacks, cultural
	language  could
	not expand
	away from
	the biological
	base indefinitely.
	Just as
	biology produced a
	floor below
	which human
	language could
	not fall,
	so it produced
	a ceiling
	above which
	human  language could
	not rise.
	The realm of
	variability of
	any species
	has upper
	limits consisting
	of capa&shy;
	cities from
	which it
	is barred
	genetically from
	ever having.
	There can be
	little doubt
	that what
	we  genetically 
	have  determines 
	how  far (and
	in what
	directions) we
	can go
	culturally in
	ways which,
	hopefully, will be
	major focal
	points of
	linguistics, philosophy
	, psychology,  and
	anthropology in
	the decades
	to come. Thus,
	though languages
	may diversify and
	complexify, they
	can never 
	become  unlearnable-
	or if they
	do, children
	will soon
	pull them
	back to
	earth again.
	


	The child 
	does not, 
	initially,  &quot;learn
	language.&quot; As
	he develops,
	


	the genetic
	program for
	language which
	is his
	hominid inheritance
	unrolls exactly
	as does
	the genetic
	program that
	determines his
	increase

	in size,
	muscular control,
	etc. &quot;Learning&quot;
	consists of
	adapting this
	program, rev1smg
	it, adjusting
	it to
	fit the
	realities of
	the cultural
	language he
	happens to
	encounter. Without
	such a
	program, the
	sim\-plest of
	cultural languages
	would  presumably be
	quite unlearnable.
	But the learning
	process  is not
	without its
	tensions-the child
	tends to
	hang on
	to his
	innate grammar
	for as
	long as
	possible- so
	that the
	&quot;learning trajectory&quot;
	of any
	human child 
	will  show 
	traces  of 
	the  bioprogram,
	and bioprogram
	rules and
	structures may make
	their way
	into  adult speech
	whenever the
	model of
	the cultural
	language is
	weakened.
	


	This, then,
	in outline
	is the  unified
	theory of
	language acquisi&shy;
	tion, creole
	language origins, 
	and general
	language  origins for
	which the present
	volume has
	amassed numerous
	and diverse
	types of
	evi&shy;
	dence. The
	question must
	now arise:
	how does
	this theory
	relate to existing
	linguistic theories,
	and what
	modifications  in 
	such  theories
	does it
	appear to
	demand?
	


	

	
	


	Generative theory
	has now
	survived for
	more than  two
	decades as the
	leading theory
	in modern
	linguistics, despite
	attacks from
	diverse quarters.
	Although in
	the course
	of this
	book I
	have said
	some harsh words
	about some
	current generative
	stances, it
	should have
	been apparent, first,
	that the
	theory expressed 
	here  would 
	probably  have
	been impossible
	to frame 
	if  generative 
	grammar  had 
	never  existed,
	and second,
	that there
	is no
	hostility between 
	the  two 
	theories  on major
	issues. The
	present theory
	complements and
	amplifies generative
	theory. The
	latter has,
	in  fact, 
	ceded  most 
	of  the 
	former's territory.
	The leading
	figures in
	generative grammar
	have simply
	ignored creoles
	and shown
	a positive
	antipathy  to 
	the  mere 
	idea of
	language origins;
	as for
	acquisition, while
	they have
	theorized about
	it, they
	have not deigned
	to get
	their hands
	dirty by
	actually examining
	it.
	


	In fact, 
	bioprogram  theory
	 and 
	Chomskyan  formal 
	universals fit
	rather well
	together, as
	illustrated in
	Figure 5.1
	on the 
	following page. The
	bioprogram language
	would constitute
	a  core structure
	for human language.
	Natural languages
	would be
	free to
	vary within
	the space  between
	 the
	outer limit
	of the
	bioprogram  and
	the overall
	limit

	imposed  by 
	formal universals,
	which  represent 
	neural limits-species&shy;
	specific limits-on human
	capacity to
	process language.

	Note, however,
	that the
	bioprogram does
	not correspond
	directly to
	superficially
	similar concepts
	such as
	&quot;substantive
	universals&quot; or
	(in one of
	its several
	senses) &quot;universal
	grammar.&quot; That
	is,
	it
	does not
	constitute a
	body of
	categories, rules,
	and structures
	that are
	necessarily shared by
	all languages.
	Indeed, above
	the trivial
	level on
	which all
	languages have
	nouns, verbs,
	oral vowels,
	etc.,  
	would argue
	that such
	a body
	could not
	exist. Language
	systems are
	wholes, and
	earlier parts
	necessarily get
	mutated to
	accommodate later
	parts. Such
	a statement would
	be wholly
	uncontroversial save
	for the
	hostility to
	process that is
	shown, quite
	gratuitously, by
	genertive
	grammar.

	In fact,
	what linguistics
	will have
	to change
	is not
	generative theory, in
	its essential
	rather than
	accidental  aspects,
	 but 
	a  set 
	of much more
	widely held
	beliefs, central
	to which
	is the
	belief that
	all existing languages
	are at
	the same
	level of
	development.  Beliefs
	that have
	no empirical
	foundation generally stem
	from some
	kind of
	politi&shy;
	cal commitment,
	and Iam
	sure that 
	this one,
	often expressed
	as
	&quot;there
	are no
	primitive languages,&quot;
	arose as
	a natural
	and indeed
	laudable reaction to
	the  claim
	
	that  thick
	 lips 
	and  subhuman 
	minds  underlie
	the characteristics
	of both
	creole and
	tribal languages.
	According to
	19th--century 
	racists,  languages
	 and 
	people  alike
	
	were  ranged
	 along a
	scale of
	being from 
	the primitive 
	Bushman  with 
	his clicks,
	grunts, and shortage
	of artifacts,
	to the 
	modern  Western 
	European  with 
	his high pale
	brow and
	plethora of
	gadgets. That 
	was  when 
	everyone, racist or
	anti-racist,
	did believe
	that  Western 
	Man  was
	superior; the
	only argument 
	was  about 
	how  nasty 
	this  superiority 
	permitted  him to
	be toward
	&quot;lesser&quot;
	breeds. Now

	language from
	&quot;level  of cultural
	attainment&quot; and
	look at

	That there
	is
	indeed no
	simple connection
	between language
	development and
	cultural
	development should
	 be 
	obvious  from
	just two facts.
	First, many 
	peoples  with 
	hunting-and-gathering 
	cultures have languages
	of horrendous
	complexity which
	seem to
	be a
	lot further from
	the bioprogram
	than  &quot;rich
	 cultural&quot; 
	languages  like
	English or
	Chinese.<sup>3</sup><sup>
	</sup>Second, creoie
	languages originated
	in  the most
	advanced cultures
	of their
	day. I
	do not
	mean that
	the strains
	of Mozart nightly
	pervaded the
	barracoons; I
	mean that
	it
	was in
	the slave
	colonies that the
	Western powers
	developed the 
	industrial  technology
	 and systems 
	of  disciplined 
	mass  labor 
	which  later, 
	with  the 
	aid  of 
	the
	


	capital amassed
	by so
	doing, they 
	generously  bestowed
	 upon 
	their own citizens.
	While creole
	speakers were
	working in
	organized bodies
	of hundreds
	or  even thousands
	and operating
	complex mechanical
	processes, the
	leading technocrats
	of Western
	Europe were
	sitting in their
	own kitchens
	with their
	handlooms. So
	much for
	simplistic &quot;culture-and-language&quot;
	  equations.

	less easy
	to lie

	or other
	European languages.
	But I
	will let
	the dedication
	of this volume
	speak for
	itself.
	


	

	
	


	The idea
	of language
	development is
	not, I
	would suspect,
	the only aspect
	of the
	present theory
	that is
	likely to
	arouse ideological
	rather than
	logical opposition.
	A great
	deal of
	human self&quot;esteem
	is vested in
	the belief
	that there
	is a
	qualitative difference
	between ours and
	other species,
	and there
	is much
	in this
	volume that might
	be thought to
	weaken such
	a belief.
	Weakening such
	a belief,
	it is
	often claimed, may
	destroy &quot;the
	Dignity of
	Man&quot; and
	lead members
	of our species
	to treat
	other members
	as if
	they were
	no more
	than beasts.
	


	One could
	 ask 
	a  Tasmanian 
	what  he 
	thought  of 
	this  claim,
	if  the 
	advanced  techniques
	 of 
	tral\splanted  English
	 foxhunters 
	had
	


	CONCLUSIONS<sub>	301</sub>
	


	left any
	Tasmanians to
	{\itshape be
	}asked. Anyone
	who casts
	a candid
	eye down the
	perspective of
	human history
	must find
	it hard
	to explain
	how the idea
	that &quot;people
	are no
	more than
	animals&quot; could
	get people
	any worse treatment
	than they
	have gotten
	already. Moreover,
	as the discussion
	of Cartesian
	dualism at
	the beginning
	of Chapter
	4 made clear,
	the position
	of this
	theory  is
	not &quot;Animals
	don't have
	souls, and we
	don't either&quot;;
	rather, it
	is
	&quot;We
	have souls,
	and animals do
	too.&quot;
	


	The result,
	I should
	have thought,
	would have
	been to
	upgrade animals
	rather than
	downgrade ourselves.
	


	Further hostility
	may arise
	from fears
	that the
	theory threatens
	free will
	and human
	perfectibility. If
	we speak
	what we
	are biologically
	programmed {\itshape to
	}speak,
	and if
	what we
	are biologically
	programmed to
	speak directly
	reflects the
	structure of
	our  central 
	nervous  system,
	then the
	thoughts we
	think must
	be biologically
	programmed too.
	


	.If
	othr
	reactions to
	the theory
	can be
	dismissed as
	knee-jerk alarm1sm,
	this one
	cannot. It
	is, I
	think, pretty
	likely that
	our think\-ing
	is species-specific,
	and therefore,
	almost by
	definition, incapable
	of providing
	adequate solutions
	{\itshape to  }the
	problems we
	see ourselves
	facing or
	of answering
	the questions
	about the
	nature of
	the universe which
	we find
	so easy
	to ask.
	If this
	is
	so, it
	is
	so. If
	it is
	even possible that
	it could
	be so,
	then the
	appropriate reaction
	is not
	to hide
	behind a smokescreen
	of rhetoric,
	but to
	determine whether
	or not
	it is
	so. rf
	it is not
	so, we
	have a
	green light
	to go
	ahead with
	human perfectibility,
	despite the
	unpromising auguries
	of our
	previous efforts
	in that
	direc\-tion. If
	it is
	so, then
	we have
	to learn
	either to
	live within
	our limits
	


	or to
	change those
	limits, if
	we can.
	For one
	thing is
	certain: if
	they exist, they
	cannot {\itshape be
	}talked away.
	<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-right: 0.21in; text-indent: 0.44in; margin-top: 0.05in; line-height: 109%">	Although I	am convinced	that future	research will	show the scope	of human	freedom {\itshape to	}be	narrower than	we had	believed, and	although there	is no	value that	I personally	rate above	human freedom, I	do not
	fmd myself
	in the
	least depressed
	by the
	prospect. Evolution
	has maintained
	a steady
	increase in
	the autonomy
	of its
	creatures with&shy;
	out, so
	far as
	I am aware,
	a single
	retrogressive step.
	We as
	a species
	may lack  the
	infinite capacities
	which some
	members of
	it have
	thought,

	and continue
	to think,
	that we
	possess, but
	the range
	of options
	open to us
	is still
	infinitely greater
	than that
	available to
	any other
	species,
	. and the
	peculiar powers
	we have
	inherited allow
	the possibility
	that we may
	one day
	transcend the
	limits of
	species. But
	we will
	not do
	this by laying
	claim
	to  capacities
	that we
	do not
	possess. We
	will do
	it only by
	determining what
	the limits
	of our species
	are, and
	then decid&shy;
	ing what
	we want to
	do about
	that knowledge.
	


	We may
	decide that
	less is
	more, small
	is beautiful,
	and that
	we must live
	within our
	cognitive means,
	even if
	so living
	entails perpetu\-ating
	the cycle
	of injustice,
	revolt, and
	more injustice
	which constitutes
	the major
	part of
	our history
	to date.
	But somehow
	I do
	not think
	that this will
	be our
	choice.
	


	One recalls
	the TV
	game show
	in which
	the quizmaster
	asks, &quot;Will you
	take the
	money  or open
	the box?&quot;
	&quot;Open the
	box, open
	the box!&quot;
	the studio
	audience roars.
	I think
	we would
	try to
	open the
	box of
	species that
	encloses us,
	even if
	we knew
	that it
	was an
	inside-out Pandora's
	Box, and
	that once
	we had
	broken :&amp;ee
	of it, all
	the terrors
	of the
	universe would
	rain down
	upon our
	heads.

	have dealt
	with that
	analysis  in
	Bickerton  (1980),
	I will
	not repeat
	my criticisms
	of it
	here.
	<ol start="2">
		<li/>


It
		would seem
		highly likely,
		indeed, that
		the inadequacies
	</ol>
	


	of existing
	creole descriptions,
	often referred
	to in
	this volume,
	have served
	to diminish,
	rather than
	exaggerate, the
	degree of
	creole simi&shy;
	larity. To
	give just
	one very
	recent instance,
	it was
	long
	held that the
	verb-focusing rule
	discussed
	 earlier
	in this
	chapter was
	not  found
	in the grammars
	of any of
	the Indian
	Ocean creoles.
	Substratomaniacs could
	point to
	the nature
	of the
	substratum-Eastern Bantu,
	Malagasy, and
	Indian languages-
	as an
	explanation of
	this. Now
	Corne (p.c.)
	reports the
	finding of
	verb-focusing structures
	with a
	copied verb
	identical to
	those discussed
	in this 
	chapter. 
	Substratomaniacs  will
	now doubtless
	seize on
	the claim
	by Baker
	(1976)
	that in
	1735,
	60 percent Â·of
	the nonwhite
	population of
	Mauritius was
	from West
	Africa. However, this
	finding is
	strongly  challenged
	 by 
	Chaudenson  (1979)
	on .the
	basis of
	historical documents
	which he claims
	Baker did
	not examine;
	according to
	Chaudenson, the
	percentage of
	West Africans
	never rose
	much above
	33.
	


	In fact,
	the outcome 
	of the
	disagreement is
	rather irrelevant
	to
	


	the real
	issue. Baker's
	&quot;60 percent&quot;
	contained 66
	percent of
	speakers from Guinea,
	and Guinean
	languages differ
	markedly in
	structure from the
	Kwa languages
	which are
	usually claimed
	as the
	source of
	creole structures. On
	Baker's own
	figures, the
	Kwa speakers
	in Mauritius
	in 1735
	must have
	amounted to
	about 130!
	Within a
	few years,
	the population of
	Mauritius topped
	the 10,000
	mark, swelled
	by recruits from
	India and
	Madagascar (Baker
	admits that
	hardly any
	Kwa speakers
	arrived
	after 1735).
	The question
	that substratomaniacs
	have to
	answer is: how
	did 130
	people manage
	to impose
	their grammar 
	(assuming they had
	a common
	one, which
	is a
	big assumption)
	upon a
	population in
	which they
	were outnumbered
	100 to
	1?

	(1979)
	observes of
	the latter
	that &quot;its
	late acquisition,
	coming after
	children hear it
	used around
	them for
	years, probably 
	stems from
	its subtle
	meaning,&quot; and
	indeed it
	is surely
	the case
	that the
	meaning of
	the &quot;composite
	past&quot; in
	French or
	Italian (a
	punctual meaning)
	is easier for
	the child
	to grasp
	than the
	meaning of
	the English
	perfect (a
	com\-pletive
	meaning). But
	this only
	opens up
	a host
	of other
	issues. For
	instance, if  the
	meaning of
	English perfect
	is &quot;relevance
	to
	present state,&quot;
	and if,
	as Antinucci
	and Miller
	suggest, the
	child assigns
	his early past
	marking on
	the basis
	of &quot;relevance
	to present
	state,&quot; why
	should the
	meaning of
	perfect  be 
	so  &quot;subtle&quot;
	in the 
	child's
	view, and why  should
	 it 
	not  be 
	the first,
	rather than
	the last,
	verb form to
	be acquired?
	Further, is
	it a
	matter of
	mere coincidence
	that perfect
	should be
	the last
	form to
	be acquired
	by both
	children learning
	English and
	speakers of
	an English
	creole in
	the course
	of decreolization
	(see
	


	.Bickerton [197
	5:126ff.]
	for details
	on the
	latter process)?
	If, as
	suggested later
	in this
	chapter, decreolization
	and the
	later stages
	of acquisition are
	processes which
	show a
	principled relationship,
	then there is
	no coincidence,
	but rather
	a joint
	reflection  of one
	of the

	other words,
	creolization and
	decreolization correspond
	to the two
	(overlapping) halves
	of the
	acquisition process
	proposed at the
	beginning of
	this chapter.
	The first
	half, dominated
	by the
	bio\-program,
	corresponds to
	creolization, but
	the second
	half, dominated by
	other components,
	in  which the
	child bridges
	the gap
	between bioprogram and
	target language,
	corresponds to 
	decreolization.
	The only
	significant difference
	would seem
	to be
	that creolization
	and decreolization cannot
	overlap, while
	the evolution
	of the
	bioprogram and the
	pressure from
	the target
	language can,
	do, and
	indeed must
	overlap. However,
	since this
	difference stems
	directly from

	differences between

	of the 
	&quot;normal&quot; child
	and the
	circumstances of

	{\itshape Hamad:
	}Let me
	just ask
	a question
	which everyone
	else who has
	been faithfully
	attending these
	sessions is
	surely burning to
	ask. If
	some rules
	you have
	described constitute
	universal constraints on
	all languages,
	yet they
	are not
	learned, nor are
	they somehow
	logically necessary
	{\itshape a
	priori,
	}how did
	language get
	that way?
	


	{\itshape Chomsky:
	}Well,
	it seems
	to me
	that would be
	like asking
	the question how
	does the
	heart get
	that way?
	I mean,
	we don't
	learn to
	have a heart,
	we don't
	learn to
	have arms
	rather than wings.
	What is
	interesting
	to me
	is that
	the question
	should be
	asked. It seems
	to be
	a natural
	question; everyone
	asks it.
	And I
	think we
	should ask why people
	ask it.
	


	

	
	


	The question
	&quot;Why
	do you
	ask that
	question?&quot; is
	 of course
	a stalling ploy
	familiar to
	psychoanalysts; indeed,
	it was
	programmed into
	the &quot;robot
	psychiatrist&quot; with
	which some
	ingenious psychologists
	were able to
	simulate, with
	surprising plausibility,
	a therapeutic
	session, The
	present writer
	believes, as
	firmly as
	Chomsky, that
	we get
	language like
	


	we get
	a heart
	and arms,
	yet I
	entirely fail
	to see
	why Harnad's
	question
	


	was an
	illegitimate one
	or why
	it does
	not deserve,
	or rather
	demand, an answer.
	How we
	first got
	arms or
	a heart
	are questions
	so phylo&shy;
	genetically remote
	and so
	unrelated to
	the mental
	life
	of our
	species that Chomsky
	is right
	to dismiss
	them as
	not worth
	asking (except,
	presumably, for
	those whose
	professional specialism
	they are).
	But the evolution
	of language
	is
	so recent
	that we
	may reasonably
	suppose that its
	present nature
	is
	still
	conditioned by
	those origins,
	and its crucial
	role in
	distinguishing between
	us and
	other species
	(while any number
	of  other species
	have arms
	and hearts)
	ls
	such that
	it must strongly
	influence, even
	if it
	does not
	wholly determine,
	all that
	we think  and
	do. Thus,
	to put  the
	determination  of
	its origins
	on a
	par
	


	with the
	determination of
	the origins
	of physical
	organs seems
	to me a
	piece of
	evasive perversity,

<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-right: 0.09in; margin-top: 0.01in; line-height: 111%">		It is		an open		question whether		any language		could make		the past-present-future		distinction before		the culture		that used		it produced any		kind of		time-measuring device.		The fact		that time-enslaved		linguists may have		analyzed preliterate		languages as		having such
		a distinction
		is, of course,
		no proof
		of anything-they
		have consistently
		done the
		same for
		creoles and
		they have
		been consistently
		wrong in
		so doing.
		In fact, there
		already exist
		more careful
		studies
		of such
		languages (e.g.,
		Arnott 1970,
		Welmers 1973)
		which explicitly
		recognize the
		absence of
		the characteristic
		Western temporal
		framework. Analysis
		of TMA
		systems is too

	or &quot;tem&shy;
	plates&quot; which
	, as
	suggested in
	some fascinating
	work by
	Marler and
	associates (Marler
	1977,
	1980;
	Marler and
	Peters 1979,
	etc.), show
	striking parallels
	to those
	of avian

	simply been
	ignored. However, these
	omissions
	in
	no way
	reflect my
	estimate of
	the impor&shy;
	tance of
	such developments.
	The reasons
	for them 
	are  threefold.
	First, reasons
	of space
	(and the
	overall purpose
	of this
	volume) pre&shy;
	vented me
	from describing
	everything that
	went into
	the makeup
	of language; second,
	these other
	developments have
	been excellently
	treated elsewhere;
	and third,
	I wanted
	to deal  precisely
	with those aspects
	of language
	development which
	have been
	most systematically
	ignored or
	misunderstood. Certainly,
	such omissions
	were not
	for the purpose
	of strengthening
	my case
	since all
	the omitted
	developments are much
	more obviously
	the product
	of the
	genetic code
	than the
	developments discussed
	in this
	volume.
	<ol start="2">
		<li/>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-right: 0.08in; margin-top: 0in; line-height: 110%">		I certainly		do not		wish to		suggest by		this that		no sooner		had language reached		the creole		level than		agriculture began.		There may well		have been		an interval		of tens		of thousands		of years between		these two even		ts, years
		during which
		cognitive maps
		became only
		gradually more complex;
		or the
		interval may
		have been
		quite short.
		There is
		no way, at
		present, that
		we can
		choose between
		these alternatives-or
		even prove
		that language
		in its
		present form
		did not
		exist two
		million
		years ago,
		although the
		latter possibility
		seems intrinsically
		unlikely.
		<li/>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-right: 0.08in; line-height: 102%">		I write &quot;seem		 to 		be&quot;  because		 only 		empirical  investigation		will		reveal whether		such languages		are indeed		as far		from the		bio\-program as		our intuitions		would suggest.		One test 		will		be the 		time taken  by

	languages. rt
	was often
	claimed (at
	a time
	when acquisition
	had hardly
	


	been studied!)
	that all
	languages were equally
	easy for children
	to learn.
	This belief
	was, of
	course, simply
	deduced from
	the &quot;all-languages-are&shy;
	developmentally-equal&quot;
	dogma. Work
	by Slobin
	and his

	this may
	be quite
	far from
	the truth.
