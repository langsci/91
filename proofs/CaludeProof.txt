Hi Sebastian,
here are my comments to the draft chapter 2 form Bickerton's book.

OK page 69, last para, line 1: there is a bracket missing

OK page 72, numbered list, point (E) is missing a bracket also

OK page 88, middle of the page, there is a bracket missing after "(1977: 23ff., 181ff.)" there should be a second bracket here

NO page 88, after para 3 there are some blank lines, the spacing might be a bit wrong here,

OK page 97, 3rd para in the last 3 lines, examples (165) and (166) are given as /165/ and /166/, round brackets should be used instead

OK page 103, para above example (202), there is a bracket missing here after the text given in italics,

OK page 114, last para, there is a missing space after "Greg Lee (p.c.)"

page 118, example at the top of the page, the numbering seems to be spaced strangely, number (262) should be at the top of the example I am guessing,


NO page 119, footnote, I think that "60%" would be better than the current "60 percent" (sorry I know we are not checking language)

OK page 121, footnote is missing a full stop at the very end of the footnote
NO page 122, top of the page, there is a strange gap after the word "desires."

OK also I found that wherever there are quotation marks, the beginning marks are fine, but the closing ones seem to be in a different style and they look a bit more like to single quotes. Maybe I am just being picky. 

Despite these remarks, I am totally impressed with the quality of the OCR.
Wow!

Hope this is helpful,
Best wishes,
Andreea
